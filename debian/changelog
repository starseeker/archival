vdslib (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * polyview/{Makefile,invmatrix.c,poly{.[ch],view{,ctrl}.c}}: modified to
    allow compilation with FLTk instead of XForms.
  * {{std,}vds,vdsprivate,vector}.h: added extern "C" { ... } linkage
    specification (it's not really necessary to add this to the last two
    files, but wth, I already did it)
  * debian/copyright: extracted from Makefile.  All the source files
    include this copyright, with the exception of polyview/trackball.[ch],
    which is property of SGI (license also extracted).
