Known bugs:
    Keyboard accelerators don't work when no CAD windows are open.
    Keyboard accellerators for snaps only work when canvas has focus.
    In some odd instances, the offset code will create a wierd line ending
      when offsetting non-closed paths.
    Sometimes offsetting will leave extraneous bad loops.
    You have to select objects with the selector tool before you can use
      manipulator tools on them.
    If you select all when in the node selector tool, and there are hundreds
      of nodes, the CAD slows down a LOT.
    The nodes aren't immediately shown on selected objects when you select
      the nodesel tool.
    The rectangular drag-select marquee doesn't work in nodesel tool mode.
    Undo doesn't seem to work with all manipulations.
    Layer renaming is only available via double-clicking on the layer name.
      We should have context menus for editing layers.
    No Distribute manipulators available yet.
    G-Code output is somewhat non-optimal at this time.
    If you hit a view key (1-9) when the backtracer is still parsing, an
      error is thrown.
    Group objects get left around when all grouped objects get deleted.
    Feed rates for large (1/4") bits appears to be buggy.  Check feed rate code.
