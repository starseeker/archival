QmlOgre
=======
QmlOgre is a library that allows integrating Ogre3D into Qt QML scenes.

Features

* Window states, the application event loop and user input are managed by Qt
* Creates an OpenGL context for Ogre which is shared with Qt's QML OpenGL context
* Allows using the full range of QML features
* Places no restriction on the depth sorting of Ogre items versus other QML elements
* Allows multiple independent cameras, each assigned to an Ogre QML item, viewing the same scene

Requirements

* Ogre 1.8
* Qt 5
