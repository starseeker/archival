Closest Point Transform

This code implements an algorithm for computing the closest point transform to
a triangle mesh surface on a regular 3-D grid. The closest point transform
finds the Euclidean distance to the triangle mesh. In addition, it can compute
the closest point on the surface, the closest triangle face in the mesh and the
gradient of the distance. The distance, etc., are computed to within a
specified distance of the surface. The closest point, closest face, distance
and gradient of the distance to the mesh surface are calculated by solving the
Eikonal equation $ |\nabla u|^2 = 1 $ with the method of characteristics. The
method of characteristics is implemented efficiently with the aid of
computational geometry and polyhedron scan conversion. The computed distance is
accurate to within machine precision. The computational complexity of the
algorithm is linear in both the number of grid points for which the distance is
computed and the size of the mesh. Thus for many problems, it has the optimal
computational complexity.
