This is a quasi-fork of the CMake boost work at https://github.com/pocb/boost but
the structure is somewhat different.

The latest boost CMake work (i.e. the newest boost) will be in master.  There
will be an "original" branch which will contain the vanilla Boost sources, and
that branch will be updated with each new version of Boost that is considered
for CMake work.

Since the pocb cmake-trunk branch appears to have left off at 1.53, that will
be our starting point.
