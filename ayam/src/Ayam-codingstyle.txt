[Ayam-codingstyle.txt]
This file contains some guidelines about how C code in the Ayam project
should be formatted and commented.

I do welcome patches (especially, if they fix bad bugs or add essential
functionality) but I will reject any code that fails to comply with the
following guidelines:

o line length must not exceed 79 characters
o indentation: Emacs-C-mode-style (2 chars) this is also
  easy to achieve with "indent" without any parameters (GNU style),
  exceptions (not mandatory):
  - local variables and last return in a function indent one character
  - glBegin()-glEnd(), glPushMatrix()-glPopMatrix(), and RiBegin()-RiEnd()
    pairs indent one character
o indentation should be carried out by <space> characters only
  (no <TAB>, as this is interpreted very differently between editors)
o all {} are on their _own_ line (resembles the look of Pascal code a bit)
o Ayam symbols and typenames are all preceded by "ay_"
o all preprocessor definitions/macros are preceded by "AY_" and are
  in ALL CAPS
o function naming convention: ay_<modulename>_getblurb<type>
  mandatory types: "cb": Ayam callback, "tcb": Togl callback,
                   "tcmd": Tcl command
o all functions end with "} /* <function_name> */"
o long if/while/for/switch-statements end with "} /* if */", "} /* while */"...
o do not use C++ comments
o no trailing white space at the end of a line
o no DOS line endings (not CRLF but just LF)
o try to follow the GNU coding standards:
  http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html
  if they do not contradict the rules stated in this document

example:

-snip-
/*
 * ay_ayam_init:
 *  create ay_root, tables
 *  In:
 *  interp: the Tcl interpreter
 *  Out:
 *  Sideeffects:
 */
int
ay_ayam_init(Tcl_Interp *interp)
{
 ay_status = AY_OK;

  ay_interp = interp;

  /* initialize tables */
  Tcl_InitHashTable(&ay_otypesht, TCL_STRING_KEYS);

  if(ay_table_init(ay_typenamest))
    {
      return AY_ERROR;
    }
  /* fill tables (init object types) */

  /* create root object */

 return ay_status;
} /* ay_ayam_init */
-snap-

Note: Those rules are not established to annoy you, but to keep the
code consistent and readable (especially for me).
