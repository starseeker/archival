Tcl/Tk 8.4.20 Release Announcement
June 1, 2013

The Tcl Core Team is pleased to announce the 8.4.20 releases of the Tcl
dynamic language and the Tk toolkit.  This is the twentieth and *FINAL*
patch release of Tcl/Tk 8.4.  With this release, support for Tcl/Tk 8.4
comes to an end.  The current release sequence for Tcl and Tk is 8.6.*.
All Tcl/Tk users are encouraged to migrate to that release sequence for
future work.

A note on Mac OS X systems:  Tk 8.4.20 continues to be implemented on
the Carbon system, as were earlier 8.4.* releases.  This means Tk 8.4.20
is not suitable for any current Mac OS X system.  It's a final patch
release of obsolete software that is useful only on equally obsolete
Mac OS X systems.  Those who need Tk suitable for current Mac OS X systems
are already using at least Tk 8.5.

More details can be found below.  We would like to express our gratitude
to all those who submit bug reports and patches.  This information is
invaluable in enabling us to identify and eliminate problems in the core.
