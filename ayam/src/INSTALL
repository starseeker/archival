INSTALL [5. May 2012]

Compilation Instructions for Ayam
---------------------------------

There are two major ways to compile Ayam: "shared" and "wrapped standalone".
The binaries you get with the binary distribution of Ayam are "wrapped
standalone". This means Tcl/Tk and the main Tcl-scripts of Ayam are all
statically combined in the executable. This means no hassle with Tcl/Tk
versions. You do not need an installed Tcl/Tk at all to run Ayam!
However, the creation of "wrapped standalone" executables of Ayam is a
bit tricky. Therefore, if you really want to or have to compile Ayam:
_Please compile a "shared" version of Ayam!_

Note: To compile Ayam on Win32 using Visual Studio 2005 Express,
use the provided workspace Ayam-*-VC2005.zip instead of the normal
source distribution.

4. Compile Time Configuration Options

1. Compiling a Shared Version of Ayam
-------------------------------------

1.1 Step 1 - Requirements
-------------------------

The following requirements _must_ be met to compile a shared
version of Ayam:

- ANSI-C-compiler
- Tcl/Tk sources ( at least V8.2, at most V8.4.19 )
  http://tcl.sourceforge.net/
  Note that a complete installation _and_ the sources of Tcl/Tk are
  required.
  This is because Ayam uses Togl, a Tk-widget that needs internal
  Tk-headers to be compiled. It is _not sufficient_ to just have
  an installed Tcl/Tk on your system, so please
  _get the source distribution_ of Tcl/Tk and get the right
  version, as Togl is known to crash if Tcl/Tk versions mismatch!
  See also Note 1 below.
- OpenGL ( gl.h, glu.h, libGL.so, libGLU.so )
  Version of GL is uncritical ( 1.1 should do, see also Note 2 ),
  Version of GLU should be atleast 1.2 ( due to the use of the GLU
  tesselation facility in the PolyMesh and SubdivisionMesh objects ),
  ( Mesa may be used as replacement for a real OpenGL. Since
    version 3.5, Mesa uses the GLU from the free OpenGL sample
    implementation from SGI and is therefore able to display
    trimmed NURBS. Either install this version of Mesa, or the GLU
    from the SGI sample implementation. )
  http://www.mesa3d.org/
- BMRT ( ri.h, slc.h, libribout.a, libslcargs.a )
  http://www.exluna.com/
  Note that BMRT's libribout.a and libslcargs.a come as binary only,
  they might not be available on your platform!
  If BMRT is not available on your platform, you can still
  compile Ayam with the Affine Toolkit with reduced functionality,
  read: no parsing of slc-compiled shaders.
  You can also use libslxargs from Aqsis ( http://www.aqsis.com/ )
  as libslcargs replacement and libri2rib from Aqsis as libribout
  replacement.
- Togl ( togl.h, togl.c )
  For most systems a working Togl is already included in the Ayam
  source distribution, see subdir togl. No download necessary!
- TIFF ( tiffio.h, libtiff.so )
  http://www.libtiff.org/
- The Affine Toolkit
  http://www.affine.com/
  Source code of Affines Simple RIB writer is distributed with Ayam
  ( see subdir "affine/" ).
  No download necessary, unless you want to compile the RRIB (RIB import)
  plugin!
- BWidgets
  http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/
  Ayam has just been tested with BWidgetsV1.2.1 so far.
  BWidgetsV1.2.1 are distributed with Ayam ( see subdir "tcl/BWidget-1.2.1/" ).
  No download necessary!

Tip:
If you unpack Tcl/Tk and BMRT as sister directories to the Ayam
directory, editing of the Makefile will be easier.

Note 1:
On most systems, there should be an installed Tcl/Tk 8.4.x nowadays.
If this is the case
( check it by typing "wish" in a shell, then type "puts $tcl_patchLevel" )
you then just have to download the sources of the installed
version ( see output of the puts command! ), unpack them,
and run configure in the unpacked source trees.
No compiling of this Tcl/Tk is necessary but you need the configured
sources in order to compile Ayam!

Note 2:
If OpenGL 1.1 is not available to you, you can still compile Ayam, if your
OpenGL is supporting the polygon offset extension (e.g. on IRIX 6.2).


1.2 Step 2 - Compiling
----------------------

You have all required software and installed/compiled it successfully?

Since Ayam1.7, a Tcl script is provided, that helps to create a basic
Makefile. Just run it by typing:
>wish ayamConf.tcl
and select your RIB-writer, shader-parser, and operating system.
Now you can make additional adjustments, e.g. determine where the
Tcl/Tk sources are, and where the TIFF library, BMRT, or Aqsis are
installed.
Then press the "Create Makefile!" button.

If you do not use ayamConf.tcl you will need to execute the following
two steps:
- copy Makefile.shared to Makefile:
>cp Makefile.shared Makefile

- edit the Makefile, until it tells you to stop, all necessary
  information should be in the Makefile ( yes, this _is_ a lot of work ):
>emacs Makefile

- if you are done editing the Makefile manually or by using ayamConf.tcl
  just enter:
>make

If you got errors while compiling, maybe the Ayam FAQ helps, see:
http://www.ayam3d.org/faq.html

Now ayamsh should be compiled and ready for a test run.
- try it:
>./ayamsh tcl/ayam.tcl


1.3 Step 3 - Installation
-------------------------

If all went fine, you can now install Ayam, switch to root and enter:
>make install

By default, Ayam will install into /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable, plugins, and scripts,
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation, and
/usr/local/ayam/scn for the example scenes.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Be sure to also add "." or "/usr/local/ayam/plugins" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall

The installation procedure also creates a shell script named "ayam",
that calls "ayamsh" the right way, so that after installation you can
start Ayam by typing:
>ayam

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
>make -n install
or
>make -n -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall
first.

Ayam also integrates with Unix desktop environments.
The next steps need the xdg-utils from the Portland project to be installed.

To install a system wide applications menu entry, enter:
>make sysmenu

The next commands should not be run as root!

To add a desktop launcher to the current users desktop, enter:
>make desktop

If Ayam was installed to a user specific directory (e.g. on systems
without root access), the following two targets add a user application
menu entry and file type:
>make menu
>make filetype

Some desktop environments require a restart to let these changes take effect!



2. Compiling a Wrapped Standalone Version of Ayam
-------------------------------------------------

2.1 Step 1 - Requirements
-------------------------

The following requirements _must_ be met to compile a wrapped standalone
version of Ayam:

- ANSI-C-compiler
- Tcl/Tk sources ( V8.2.x (see also Note 1) )
  http://tcl.sourceforge.net/
  Note that you do not need to _install_ Tcl/Tk to compile and use
  the wrapped standalone version of Ayam. But compiling this Tcl/Tk
  is still necessary. Compile static versions of Tcl/TK using:
  >cd tcl8.2.x/unix
  >./configure --disable-shared; make
  >cd tk8.2.x/unix
  >./configure --disable-shared; make
  Also note that Wrap0.3 currently only works with Tcl/Tk 8.2.x, not
  8.3.x, and not 8.4.x (see also Note 1)!
- A zip utility that understands the -A option ( zip2.2 does ).
- Wrap0.3
  http://purl.oclc.org/net/nijtmans/wrap.html
  Please compile a static "libz":
  >make z
  and a wrapped "wish" using wrap:
  >make
  and do not "make clean" afterwards. Note that Makefile.wrapped
  is tuned to be used with Wrap0.3. If you use newer versions you
  will likely have to adapt the ayam: and ayamwrap: targets.
  If compile errors occur, note that in fact you only need the following
  files from Wrap0.3 to successfully compile a wrapped Ayam:
  wrapChan.o, wrapInit.o, wrapRsrc.o, compat/tclLoadNone.o, tkAppInit.o
  You might be able to build them manually using e.g. "make tkAppInit.o"...
- OpenGL ( gl.h, glu.h, libGL.so, libGLU.so )
  Version of GL is uncritical ( 1.1 should do, see also Note 2 ),
  Version of GLU should be atleast 1.2 ( due to the use of the GLU
  tesselation facility in the PolyMesh and SubdivisionMesh objects ),
  ( Mesa may be used as replacement for a real OpenGL. Since
    version 3.5, Mesa uses the GLU from the free OpenGL sample
    implementation from SGI and is therefore able to display
    trimmed NURBS. Either install this version of Mesa, or the GLU
    from the SGI sample implementation. )
  http://www.mesa3d.org/
- BMRT ( ri.h, slc.h, libribout.a, libslcargs.a )
  http://www.exluna.com/
  Note that BMRT's libribout.a and libslcargs.a come as binary only,
  they might not be available on your platform!
  If BMRT is not available on your platform, you can still
  compile Ayam with the Affine Toolkit with reduced functionality,
  read: no parsing of slc-compiled shaders.
  You can also use libslxargs from Aqsis ( http://www.aqsis.com/ )
  as libslcargs replacement and libri2rib from Aqsis as libribout
  replacement.
- Togl ( togl.h, togl.c )
  For most systems a working Togl is already included in the Ayam
  source distribution, see subdir togl. No download necessary!
- TIFF ( tiffio.h, libtiff.so )
  http://www.libtiff.org/
- The Affine Toolkit
  http://www.affine.com/
  Source code of Affines Simple RIB writer is distributed with Ayam
  ( see subdir "affine/" ).
  No download necessary, unless you want to compile the RRIB (RIB import)
  plugin!
- BWidgets
  http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/
  Ayam has just been tested with BWidgetsV1.2.1 so far.
  BWidgetsV1.2.1 are distributed with Ayam ( see subdir "tcl/BWidget-1.2.1/" ).
  No download necessary!


Tip:
If you unpack Tcl/Tk, Wrap, and BMRT as sister directories
to the Ayam directory, editing of the Makefile will be easier.

Note 1:
The official Ayam 1.13 Linux executable proves that with some surgery, also
newer Tcl/Tk versions work with Wrap0.3 (atleast the Tcl scripts in the
wrap0.3/lib directory need to be replaced with the new versions from the
Tcl/Tk distribution).

Note 2:
If OpenGL 1.1 is not available to you, you can still compile Ayam, if your
OpenGL is supporting the polygon offset extension (e.g. on IRIX 6.2).


2.2 Step 2 - Compiling
----------------------

You have all required software and installed/compiled it successfully?

- copy Makefile.wrapped to Makefile:
>cp Makefile.wrapped Makefile

- edit the Makefile, until it tells you to stop, all necessary
  information should be in the Makefile ( yes, this _is_ a lot of work ):
>emacs Makefile

- issue a
>make

If you got errors while compiling, maybe the Ayam FAQ helps, see:
http://www.ayam3d.org/faq.html

Now Ayam should be compiled and ready for a test run.
- try it:
>./ayam


2.3 Step 3 - Installation
-------------------------

If all went fine, you can now install Ayam, switch to root and enter:
> make install

By default, Ayam will install into /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable, plugins, and scripts,
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation, and
/usr/local/ayam/scn for the example scenes.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Use ayam.sh to start the application or be sure to also add "." or
"/usr/local/ayam/bin/plugins" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
> make -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
> make -n install
or
> make -n -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall
first.

Ayam also integrates with Unix desktop environments.
The next steps need the xdg-utils from the Portland project to be installed.

To install a system wide applications menu entry, enter:
root> make sysmenu

The next commands should not be run as root!

If Ayam was installed to a user specific directory (e.g. on systems
without root access) use the menu target instead of sysmenu:
user> make menu

To add a desktop launcher to the current users desktop, enter:
user> make desktop

To create a file type on the current users desktop:
user> make filetype

Some desktop environments require a restart to let these changes take effect!



3. Additional Targets (Compiling Plugins)
-----------------------------------------

Independent from the build type of Ayam, the Makefiles contain
additional targets to build plugins and manage the installation.

Before compiling any plugins, the Makefile must be set up properly
for the compilation of Ayam.

If you get errors while compiling plugins, maybe the Ayam FAQ helps, see:
http://www.ayam3d.org/faq.html


3.1 MF3D Import/Export Plugin
-----------------------------

To compile the MF3D Import/Export plugin two steps are required:
>make mf3d
( to compile the MF3D code from Apple (Duet) )
and
>make mfio.so
( to compile the plugin )

Load the plugin via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "File/Import/Apple 3DMF" and "File/Export/Apple 3DMF"
respectively.


3.2 RIB Import Plugin (RRIB)
----------------------------

Additional prerequisites for the RIB import plugin:
You need the full Affine distribution
( download it from http://www.affine.com/ )!

Compile libribrdr.a, libribhash.a and libribnop.a.
This is done using 
>cd affine

>make setup<your platform>
( use "sun" as platform on Linux )

If you are using Affine0008 you need to tune Affine to _not_
use libz by editing "config.mak":
o remove "-lz" from the variable ZLIB
o remove "-DRIB_ZLIB" from COPTS

If you are using Affine0008 and gcc you, additionally, need to change
"readrib/declare.c":
o change all occurences of the variable "inline" to "myinline"
( gcc does not like variables named "inline" without -ansi, but fails
to compile other parts of Affine if -ansi is enabled )

now compile Affine:
>make World
Ignore errors, unless you do not get "lib/librdr.a" or "lib/libribhash.a".
In case you do not have "lib/libribnop.a" now, build it:
>cd ributil
>make ../lib/libribnop.a

go back to Ayam:
>cd ayam/src
Point your Ayam Makefile to the Affine libraries,
see the variable RRIBLIBS.
Watch out for possible version clashes of header files
( ayam/src/affine/include vs. affine/include ).
The version of the Affine headers currently distributed with Ayam
is 0008. If needed, just copy the headers from the Affine distribution
to the Ayam distribution.

Now compile the plugin:
>make rrib.so

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "File/Import/RenderMan RIB"


3.3 Importance Driven Rendering Plugin (IDR)
--------------------------------------------

There are no additional prerequisites to compile IDR, just type:
>make idr.so

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "Custom/Open IDR".


3.4 Shader Parsing Plugins
--------------------------

Ayam supports the following shader parsing plugins:
"ayslb" for Air, "ayslc" for BMRT, "ayso" for RDC, "ayslo" for PRMan,
"ayslx" for Aqsis, "ayslo3d" for 3Delight, and "aysdr" for Pixie.
Additional prerequisites:
The respective renderer has to be installed to compile a shader parsing
plugin. To compile "aysdr", the Pixie renderer source tree has to be
available, configured, and compiled.

In order to compile a shader parsing plugin, adapt the following variables
in the Makefile:
for Aqsis: AQSISDIR, AYSLXINCDIR, AYSLXLIBS,
for BMRT: BMRTDIR, AYSLCINCDIR, AYSLCLIBS,
for RenderDotC: RDCDIR, AYSOINCDIR, AYSOLIBS,
for PRMan: PRMANDIR, AYSLOINCDIR, AYSLOLIBS,
for 3Delight: 3DLDIR, AYSLO3DINCDIR, AYSLO3DLIBS,
for Pixie: SDRDIR, AYSDRINCDIR, PIXIESRC, AYSDRLIBS
for Gelato: GELDIR, AYGSOINCDIR, AYGSOLIBS

then type:
>make ayslb.so
>make ayslc.so
>make ayslo.so
>make ayslo3d.so
>make ayso.so
>make ayslx.so
>make aysdr.so
>make aygso.so

After loading of one of these plugins (e.g. using the main menu entry
"File/Load Plugin") the internal shader scanning code of Ayam will
be disabled, and Ayam will from that moment on just scan shaders of the
renderer that the plugin supports.


3.5 AyCSG (CSG Preview) Plugin
------------------------------

Additional prerequisites to compile the AyCSG plugin are:
OpenCSG ( get it from http://www.opencsg.org/ )
GLEW ( GLEW is included in OpenCSG, otherwise get it from
 http://glew.sourceforge.net/ )
RenderTexture (RenderTexture is included in OpenCSG, otherwise get it from
 http://www.markmark.net/misc/rendertexture.html )

Your OpenGL subsystem has to support PBuffers or the frame buffer object
extension.
 ( Check with "glxinfo". If you have no GLX PBuffers you can compile Ayam
   with Mesa without hardware acceleration to get PBuffers support. )

Download and compile all prerequisites. Compile the example application
of OpenCSG and try it to check whether your OpenGL subsystem is compatible.

In order to compile the plugin, adapt the following variables
in the Ayam Makefile:
OPENCSGDIR, GLEWDIR

then type:
>make aycsg.so

Load the plugin via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use the plugin via the new icon in the view menu bar.
See also the AyCSG preferences in the main menu "Custom/AyCSG Preferences".


3.6 onio (OpenNURBS IO) Plugin for Rhino 3DM
--------------------------------------------

Additional prerequisites to compile the onio plugin are:
OpenNURBS ( get it from http://www.opennurbs.com/ ).

Just type:
>make objio.so

to compile the plugin.

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "File/Import/Wavefront OBJ" and
"File/Export/Wavefront OBJ", respectively.


3.9 MOPSI (Mops Import) Plugin
------------------------------

There are no additional prerequisites to compile the mopsi plugin.
Just type:
>make mopsi.so

to compile the plugin.

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "File/Import/Mops".


3.10 X3DIO (Web3D X3D IO) Plugin
--------------------------------

Additional prerequisites to compile the x3dio plugin are:
Expat and SCEW.

In order to compile the plugin, adapt the following variables
in the Ayam Makefile:
EXPATDIR, SCEWDIR

then type:
>make x3dio.so

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "File/Import/Web3D X3D" and "File/Export/Web3D X3D",
respectively.


3.11 SDNPatch (Subdivision NURBS) Plugin
----------------------------------------

Additional prerequisites to compile the sdnpatch plugin are:
libsnurbs, libply (already contained in libsnurbs distribution) and,
depending on your compiler, boost.

In order to compile the plugin, adapt the following variables
in the Ayam Makefile:
SNURBSDIR, SDNPATCHINC

then type:
>make sdnpatch.so

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".
Use it via menu entry "Create/Custom/SDNPatch" and "Custom/SDNPatch".


3.12 jsinterp (JavaScript Scripting) Plugin
-------------------------------------------

Additional prerequisites to compile the jsinterp plugin are:
Mozilla SpiderMonkey V1.7 ( get it from http://www.mozilla.org/ )

In order to compile the plugin, adapt the following variables
in the Ayam Makefile:
JSDIR, JSINC, JSLIB

then type:
>make jsinterp.so

a Lua comment:
-- Ayam, use: Lua


3.14 Superformula Curve Plugin
------------------------------

In order to compile the plugin, type:
>make sfcurve.so

Load it via menu entry "File/Load Plugin".


3.15 Installing/Uninstalling Ayam
---------------------------------

Use
>make install
to install Ayam into the system.

By default, Ayam will install into /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable,
/usr/local/ayam/lib for the plugins and accompanying Tcl files, and
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Be sure to also add "." or "/usr/local/ayam/lib" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/ayam/lib/Makefile uninstall

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
>make -n install
or
>make -n -f /usr/local/ayam/lib/Makefile uninstall
first.

Use
>make clean
to remove all objects; this step is necessary if you switch build types
( shared <-> wrapped )!

>make mostlyclean
to make clean but not remove the objects that never change,
like Apples mf3d code and Affines sribw code.


3.16 Creating an application bundle on MacOSX
---------------------------------------------

Since Ayam 1.9, the Ayam source distribution contains a skeleton
directory structure for an application bundle in the "bin" directory
and the Makefile for the shared version of Ayam contains a new target
named "Ayam.app" to fill this skeleton appropriately.

After compilation of Ayam and plugins just type:
>make Ayam.app

to fill the application bundle with the necessary files. After that
you can start Ayam using a double click on the application bundle in
the finder.
You can also then "install" Ayam easily by dragging the filled
application bundle to your "Programs" folder in the finder.

Since Ayam 1.10, there is a second target "Ayam.appfw" to build an
application bundle, that, additionally, contains the Tcl/Tk frameworks.
The application bundles built with the Ayam.appfw target will only use
the Tcl/Tk frameworks from the bundle, regardless what is installed in
the system.
To use this target download and compile your own Tcl/Tk frameworks, then
copy them _manually_ to the application bundle skeleton like this:

>cp -R build/tcl/Tcl.framework ayam/bin/Ayam.app/Contents
>cp -R build/tk/Tk.framework ayam/bin/Ayam.app/Contents

maybe you need to do:

>chmod u+w ayam/bin/Ayam.app/Contents/Tcl.framework/Versions/Current/Tcl
>chmod u+w ayam/bin/Ayam.app/Contents/Tk.framework/Versions/Current/Tk

now; then you can

>cd ayam/src
>make Ayam.appfw

to mate the frameworks and the Ayam executable in the application bundle.

Note that the application bundle targets only work properly for the Aqua
version of Ayam and that the Aqua version of Ayam will not respond to any
MacOSX AppleScript application events unless started from the application
bundle.



4. Compile Time Configuration Options
-------------------------------------

All compile time configuration options are controlled via preprocessor
symbols that have to be defined at compile time. The value of the
respective definition is irrelevant. Or, in other words, if the value
of a definition is 0, the corresponding option is _not_ turned off!
All that counts is the presence of the definition. You can add a
definition easily using the -D command line option of your C/C++ compiler.
You do this by adding elements like "-DAYWITHAQUA" to the CFLAGS variable
in the Makefile.

Here is a complete list of all compile time configuration options
supported by Ayam:

Platform support:
AYWITHAQUA - set if you compile for Mac OS X Aqua (also enables work-arounds
 for bugs in Apple OpenGL)
AYIRIXBUG - enable workaround for SGI GLU bug
SOLARIS_BUG - enable workaround for Solaris Xmu bug in Togl
AYENABLEWAIT - enable bugfix to avoid zombie processes upon rendering (Linux)
AYENABLEFEXIT - enable fast exit procedure (Mac OS X)
AYNOUNISTDH - set if your system has no unistd.h header file, if you set
 this option the rotation of views with cursor keys held down will quickly
 fill up the undo buffer
AYNOTEMPNAM - set if your system has no tempnam() function, if you set
 this option the TmpDir preference setting will be ignored for the creation
 of temporary RIB files (i.e. for rendering from a view) and the RIB files
 will end up in a place determined by your system
AYGLUATTRIBBUG - enable workaround for a GLU bug (no NURBS display
 after NURBS tesselation was in use)

Additional features:
AYENABLEPPREV - enable permanent preview feature
AYNOSAFEINTERP - let scripts of Script objects and NS tags run in the main
 interpreter
