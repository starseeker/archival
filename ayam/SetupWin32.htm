<H1>Ayam Win32 Setup</H1>

The executable of Ayam is located in the directory named "bin".<br>
You do not need to install Ayam in the system, you can start it
directly with a double click from where you unpacked the archive.<br>
If you get error messages about input or output file handles
when trying to render directly from Ayam, please use the
accompanying batch file "ayam.bat" to start Ayam.<p>

On the first start of Ayam, the following things have to be done:
<UL>
 <LI> Saving Preferences
 <LI> Setting up Shaders
 <LI> Creating and Saving a Working Environment
</UL>

Do not worry about any error messages in red color, that appear
in the console on first startup. We are going to fix them now.


<H2>1. Saving Preferences</H2>

All preference settings (Menu: "Edit/Preferences") are
automatically saved when you leave Ayam.<br>

The preferences are saved to the file:<br>
"$(HOME)/ayamrc" if the environment variable "HOME" exists<br>
"$(TEMP)/ayamrc" else<p>

The following steps need to be done if you (for some reason)
do not like it that way, or the preferences end up in silly
places (e.g. Win95 is setting your $(HOME) to "C:/", so that
the preferences end up in "C:/ayamrc"...).<br>
However, if anything is fine with you, just skip to Step 2 now.<p>

You can change the path and filename of the preference settings
using the environment variable "AYAMRC".<br>
How do you set an environment variable?<p>

Edit the batch file "ayam.bat" (This does not work on WindowsNT!):
<UL>
 <LI> quit Ayam
 <LI> remove the leading ";" from the line ";SET AYAMRC=C:/ayam/myayamrc"
 <LI> change the path to a more appropriate setting
 <LI> use the batch file "ayam.bat" to start Ayam
</UL>

Alternatively:
<UL>
 <LI> quit Ayam
 <LI> WinXP: open Start/Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables<br>
Add a new variable named "AYAMRC" and set it e.g. to C:/ayam/myayamrc
 <LI> WinNT/2000: open Start/Settings/Control Panel/System/Environment<br>
Add a new variable named "AYAMRC" and set it e.g. to C:/ayam/myayamrc
(You need to be administrator on Win2000 to be able to
 <LI> Win95/98/98SE: From the start menu, choose "Run" and enter
"sysedit", then click "Ok".
Select the window that is displaying "AUTOEXEC.BAT".
Add the line
SET AYAMRC=C:/ayam/myayamrc<br>
to it. 
 <LI> WinME: Open Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools/System Information.
This brings up a window titled "Microsoft Help and Support".
From here, choose the tools menu, then select the system configuration
utility. Click the environment tab.
Add a new variable named "AYAMRC" and set it e.g. to C:/ayam/myayamrc
 <LI> restart Windows
 <LI> start Ayam again
</UL>

You can switch off automatic saving of preferences on exit using the
preference setting "Main/AutoSavePrefs".
If you switched off AutoSavePrefs, you can enforce saving of the
preferences using the menu entry "File/Save Prefs".<p>

Remember: NEVER use backslashes (\) in any path or filename you enter to
Ayam.<p>

<H2>2. Setting up Shaders</H2>

What are shaders? For the moment, we can safely assume that
shaders are small files that carry material descriptions.
Some example shaders come with your RenderMan compatible renderer
(e.g. BMRT), but you may also create your own of course.<br>
Currently, Ayam can only work with shaders that have been
compiled with "slc" from BMRT, so you should get and
install BMRT from
<A HREF="http://www.exluna.com/">http://www.exluna.com/</A>.
Now you need to point Ayam to the directories where your slc-compiled
shaders reside in order to use them with the material
objects in Ayam.
This is done using the preference setting "Main/Shaders".
Just open the preferences, enter the appropriate paths (separated by ";")
into the string entry labeled "Shaders".<br>
An example string could look like this:<br>
D:/BMRT2.6/shaders/;D:/Ayam/scn/shaders/<br>
Now press the "Scan Shaders" button below and watch the console for
error messages.<p>

Remember: NEVER use backslashes (\) in any path or filename you enter to Ayam.


<H2>3. Creating and Saving a Working Environment</H2>

The working environment is simply an almost empty Ayam scene file,
that contains the specification of some view windows.
This file is loaded automatically on every start of Ayam and
presents you with a standard working environment, consisting
of e.g. a traditional 3-view layout (Front, Side, Perspective).

<UL>
 <LI> Open and arrange as many views as you like using the
menu entry "Create/View".<br>
If Ayam crashes or blocks during opening of a view
then probably something with your OpenGL setup is seriously broken.
Fix this, then return here.
 <LI> Save the environment using the menu entry
"Special/Save Environment". This will save the environment
to the file given in the preference setting "Main/EnvFile".
The default setting is "~/2view.ay".
The tilde "~" always expands to the home directory of the current user.
If you have a single or no user on your system you might want
to put an absolute path into the preference setting
"Main/EnvFile" first (e.g. set it to "D:/ayam/2view.ay").<br>
Do not switch off the preference setting "Main/LoadEnv",
as this would inhibit automatic loading of the working
environment on startup.
</UL>

Remember: NEVER use backslashes (\) in any path or filename you enter to
Ayam.<p>

Quit the application and start it again; then
download "Tutorial #1" and do it.
