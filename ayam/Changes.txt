  be aligned to the space of the current parent object
o cycling through the modelling modes now automatically realigns and
  redraws the view
o cycling view types of local views now also automatically realigns the view
o when zooming, grid drawing now stops automatically just before the grid
  lines would fill the entire background of the view

GUI:
o view type and modelling mode are now displayed in the modelling mode
  menu icon as letter in the upper left and lower right corner, respectively
o instances in the clipboard are automatically cleared upon "File/New" now
  (if their respective master object is in the scene, not the clipboard)

o fixed drawing/shading of sphere objects (SF 3054130)
o fixed single point editing of PolyMesh and SDMesh objects (SF 3094086)

Modelling:
o the default zoom view (<o>) and direct point edit (<p>) keyboard
  shortcuts are now (<V>) and (<E>) respectively to make way for two
  very important new shortcuts:
o modelling actions like move, scale, or rotate no longer decide
  what to transform (objects or selected points) based on the point
  selection; now always objects are transformed, until the user
  switches explicitly to points using <p> (while <o> can be used to switch
  back to objects)
o the point transformation state is displayed in the modelling mode icon
  by a little red dot
o the mark is now reset on double <Esc>
o direct point editing now uses the point selection instead of an own pointer;
  thus, it now works with multiple selected objects, and one may apply
  coordinate values to multiple (selected) points
o the Revolve tool object now supports arbitrary ThetaMax values in
  B-Spline mode (Sections != 0)
o added Arc and Radius parameters to create closed B-Spline curve tool
o added Radius, TMin, and TMax parameters to NCircle object creation dialog
o added modelling action to snap the selected points to the mark
  (new shortcut <M>)
o added modelling action to snap the selected objects to the mark
  (new shortcut <K>)
o added view action to pan the view to the mark (new shortcut <.>)
o to avoid clashes, collapse and explode actions have new default
  keyboard shortcuts: <q> and <Q>
o the find u modelling action now works with provided objects, and
  is more exact
o added find uv modelling action that finds the u and v parameters for a
  picked point on a NURBS surface; invoke via new view shortcut: <U>
o added preference setting and facility to manage a global mark,
  if enabled, all views share a single mark; thus, one can set it in
  one view and use it in another
o improved order changes for periodic NURBS curves via the property GUI
o added "3DPVN" curve offset mode that offsets a curve along normals
  supplied via a primitive variable tag
o creating ExtrNC/ExtrNP objects via the main menu now automatically adds a
  remove property tag ("RP Transformations") to the created instance child
  so that the instance always follows the transformations of the surface
  the curve/sub-surface is extracted from
o NURBS curve clamping now works with half clamped curves and also with
  curves where there are multiple knots in the end region(s)
o NURBS curve clamping can now also clamp only one end of the curve
o NURBS patch clamping now works with half clamped patches and also with
  patches where there are multiple knots in the end region(s)
o NURBS patch clamping can now also clamp only one end of the patch
o the point insert/delete modelling actions now work with multiple
  selected objects
o several objects now support read only points, which can be selected and
  their coordinates inquired (for snapping/aligning or transformation purposes)
  but they can not be modified; the supporting objects are:
  Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Disk, Cone, Torus, Hyperboloid, Paraboloid,
  Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Swing, Skin, Birail1, Birail2, Gordon, Cap,
  Bevel, ExtrNC, ExtrNP, OffsetNC, OffsetNP, ConcatNC, ConcatNP, Clone,
  Script, Instance, Text

GUI:
o AutoFocus is now available (again) for single window GUI mode; here it
  manages the focus of internal widgets (views, tree, properties, console)
o Tool dialogs now display a more descriptive window name
o tree drag and drop now keeps the object selection intact and opens
  the target level
o starting modelling actions from the toolbox now also considers the
  AutoFocus preference setting, if enabled, the action is started in all
  view windows
o added keyboard shortcuts to manage the current level and the object
  selection directly in a view window: (<Ctrl+4>, <Ctrl+6>: go up/down,
  <Ctrl+2>, <Ctrl+8>: select next/previous object, <Ctrl+Shift+2>,
  <Ctrl+Shift+8>: extend selection to next/previous object, all numbers
  on the numeric keypad!

Scripts/Scripting Interface:
o number conversion errors are now correctly detected and reported in all
  scripting interface commands
o added "-world" option to setPnt/getPnt commands (to transform coordinates
  from/to world space)
o renamed "-p" option to "-eval" for getPnt
o getPnt can now work with arbitrary object types (even from plugins) as
  long as they support single point editing; i.e. it now works with PolyMesh,
  SDMesh, and SDNPatch objects
o the "hSL" command has been removed from safe interpreters, use "sL" instead
o added a JavaScript interpreter plugin
o Script objects can now use arbitrary languages provided by plugins
  (e.g. JavaScript)
o added a example Script object script (written in JavaScript) that creates
  a Polyhedron from a Conway notation ("polyhedron.js")

Documentation/Example Files:
o documentation of modelling actions enhanced with tables containing
  keyboard shortcuts and icons

  symmetric curves for symmetric data point configurations automatically
o improved section mode offset curves for internal multiple points
o added modelling actions for scaling/stretching about a marked point
o keyboard shortcuts for rotate/scale about follow a new scheme, where
  first the basic operation has to be selected (e.g. <r> for rotate),
  then, with a second keypress (<a>), rotate about mark is enabled
o the marked point for the "about the mark" modelling actions now survives
  much more view attribute changes, e.g. zooming; in addition, the mark,
  once set, may be re-used in following actions by pressing <Return>
  in the intermediate mark setting action
o added setting the mark to the center of gravity of all selected
  objects or selected points in the intermediate mark setting action
  (shortcuts <c> and <C>, respectively)
o added way to constrain the move object/points action to one axis;
  new keyboard shortcuts: <mx>, <my>, and <mz>

  File/Insert), saving of this scene now automatically omits the root/views
  of the current scene
o added keyboard shortcuts to manipulate the selection and walk the object
  hierarchy from view windows (by default using a modifier key in conjunction
  with the numeric keypad cursor keys; the modifier key depends on the
  platform: defaults are "Control" (on UNIX/X11), "Command" (on Aqua) and
  "Windows" (on Win32)

  create non empty PolyMesh objects this way

Documentation/Example Files:
o added Doxygen documentation for main Ayam headers

  operation if this happens
o the "ConcatNC" object can now also create a fillet for a single parameter
  curve to close it
o the BWidgets package is now requested with exact version (1.2.1) so that
  newer (inkompatible) installed versions of BWidgets can cause no harm
o added a compile time option "-DAYWITHAQUA" to distinguish between
  MacOSX-Aqua and MacOSX-X11
o added Tcl scripting interface command "wrib" that lets you export RIBs

o added a new sub menu to the "Special" main menu: "RIB-Export", it allows
  you to export a RIB from a selected "Camera" object, and to create shadow
  maps
o added RIB export from selected objects feature (menu
  "Special/RIB-Export/Selected Objects")

  "Instance") to be used as trim curves
o added a keyboard shortcut for the "Edit Master"-Feature (<Ctrl+M>)
o the console prompt now displays the name of the operations that can be
  undone and redone respectively


[07. Feb 2003] Ayam 1.4:
========================
o bug fixes:
  - fixed remembering of the state of the object selection listbox/tree
    when the context menu or a double click on the label is used to
    switch between both representations or the toolbox window is closed
    using the window decoration close button
  - fixed broken RIB-export of Clone objects
  - fixed broken RIB-export of RiAttribute/RiOption color/point tags

    material object is in the root level of the scene
  - fixed "align view" setting a wrong up-vector for views of type "Top"
  - fixed object picking by dragging the mouse in conjunction with
    "draw level only" rendering the view useless
  - fixed "move view" action not working properly in local aligned views
    of type "Top"
  - fixed object listbox context menu generating an empty Tcl error message
  - fixed official Linux executable not be able to execute other NVidia-OpenGL
    using programs (by patching the Tcl-source to not use vfork() but fork())

  - fixed object picking when the root object is hidden
  - fixed omitting shaders with array arguments from the lists of
    available shaders

    in views of type "Side", when the view is additionally moved sideways
  - fixed view objects not reading "BGImage" and "DrawBG" parameters from
    scenes written by Ayam 1.3
  - fixed RIB-import not resetting the object name when done importing,
    leading to wrongly named objects for the next invocation of RIB-import
  - fixed creation of NURBS curves with desired length 2 or 3 creating
    a wrong NURBS curve specification (too high order, wrong knot vector)
  - fixed broken creation of shadow maps from point light sources that make
    use of their "From"-values
  - fixed preference setting TclPrecision being ignored
  - fixed RIB export of scenes using instances and shadow maps
o reduced number of redraws when selecting hidden or material objects

  a different hider algorithm
o added import of RiDisplay and RiHider statements to the RIB-import plugin
o added french translations for the preferences balloon help texts
  (Michel Armand)
o added PolyMesh optimization tool, that reduces the number of control
  points (Frank Pagels)

  sampling-tolerance, and lazy-notification via function keys
o the Mops import options have been moved from the preferences to
  a small option requester
o the direct point editing dialogue is now always transient
o rotate about modelling action: the point to rotate about is now
  snapped to grid coordinates immediately
o the Sweep is now much faster for highly curved trajectories
  (e.g. the speedup factor for the "sgi cube" is about 4.5)
o added a close option to the Sweep object, that closes the resulting
  swept surface, even though the trajectory curve is not and arranges
  for the first and last section to be parallel
o the Sweep now interprets a third child curve as scaling function
o the Clone object can now also place the created clones along a curve
  and rotate them accordingly (similar to the section curves of a Sweep)
o multiple point selection via mouse drag has been improved greatly,
  it is now much faster and selects also points that are hidden behind
  other points
o added edit master feature (main menu "Edit/Master") that finds and
  selects the master object of an instance object (similar to the edit
  material feature)
o "align view" now aligns to the object space of the selected object
  (and not just to the object space of the current parent object);
  in addition, grids are now drawn and handled correctly for aligned views
o the configure menu of view windows has been rearranged to make it more
  clear, that aligned local views not only draw a grid aligned to local
  object space, but that editing takes also place in that space

  "Configure/Edit Local"
o the handles of editable points of objects are now only drawn, when
  a modelling action is in effect, that could modify editable points
o added support for "RiSides" to the RiAttribute property of material
  objects; RIB-import now also handles RiSides
o the RenderGUI windows look a little bit nicer now on the Win32 platform
o added an internal kill command for the Win32 platform ("w32kill") that
  may be used by the RenderGUIs to stop the rendering (set hidden preference
  option "Kill" to "w32kill" to accomplish this)

  subdivision meshes
o edited points are now immediately snapped to grid coordinates
o direct point editing dialogue now stays open all the time
o added a Local/Global menu to the direct point editing dialogue

  events delivered to other windows when the splash screen is closed
  manually by the user
o added some example scenes to demonstrate new features of ConcatNC, Clone,
  and Sweep objects
o added invert point selection feature (see new main menu entry:
  "Special/Points/Invert Selection")
o the Win32 executable is now statically linked with the GLU library from
  the free OpenGL sample implementation (OSS) from SGI; the compiled library
  (superglu) kindly provided by the Coin3D project (http://www.coin3d.org/)
o added support for user defined clipping planes; RIB-import now also
  handles RiClipping
o views of type "Trim" now draw the bounds of the parametric space as
  a rectangle again
o added a new preference setting "AutoFocus" that arranges for all views and
  the main window to take over the focus automatically when the mouse pointer
  enters it (without the need to adapt any window manager configuration and
  also working fine on Win32)
o added support for the mouse wheel to the Win32 version
o RIB-export now writes different frame numbers for shadow maps and the
  image so that you may re-render e.g. just the image more easily even
  when the "ShadowMaps" preference setting is "Automatic"


[15. Oct 2002] Ayam 1.3:
========================
o bug fixes:
  - fixed memory leaks in the shadow map RIB export module
  - fixed ICurves crash for length 2
  - fixed insert and delete point action errors for drag mouse events
  - fixed errors with transformed MetaBall components (e.g. of type custom)
  - fixed broken scene change detection (that occured when the undo
    system was switched off using an "UndoLevels" preference setting of -1)
  - fixed wrong reference counter setting of material objects created
    by the RIB import plugin
  - fixed converted caps of Extrude objects losing their trimcurves
    when saved and then read again
  - fixed automatic cap generation for various tool objects
  - fixed picking of objects in instanced levels
  - fixed problems with shader/plugin search path names with spaces
  - fixed some dialogues not returning the focus to the main or the view
    window when closed with the Ok/Cancel-button
  - fixed property listbox context menu generating an empty Tcl error
    message on the Win32 platform
  - fixed setting of current filename for scenes loaded via command
    line argument
  - fixed broken detection of recursive instances for copy-and-paste and
    drag-and-drop operations with instance objects
  - fixed broken "zoom to object" action for instances with transformed
    master objects
  - fixed automatic instancing for cap objects
  - fixed broken notification of several tool objects without open view
    window (e.g. after loading a scene with no view windows)
  - fixed drawing of misplaced markers for the "rotate_about" and "find_u"
    modelling actions (when used with view actions such as "move_view")
  - fixed dropping of light or camera objects onto view objects updating
    the wrong view window sometimes
o added a permanent preview feature; a constantly open RIB stream
  to a (fast) RenderMan renderer like rgl immediately displays all
  changes in the scene without the need to repeatedly hit "Ctrl-r" and
  close the preview window again (due to the complex handling, this is
  a compile time feature, and not available in the distributed Ayam binaries)
o added manual control for the creation of ShadowMaps; for that,
  the preference setting "RIB-Export/ShadowMaps" is now a menu
  for the values "Never", "Automatic", and "Manual"; in "Manual" mode
  ShadowMaps may be rendered explicitly using the new view menu
  entry "View/Create ShadowMaps"; afterwards it is possible to render
  images without recreating the ShadowMaps all the time (e.g. for camera
  or material changes) even directly from a view window
o the "TclPrecision" preference setting has been moved to the "Misc"
  preferences section
o added balloon help for all preference settings
o added a "Locale" preference setting and a locale system, that allows to
  display language specific balloon help texts (german translations of
  various balloon help texts provided initially)
o the coordinate system (the root object) now also draws axis names (x, y, z)
o scene loading now blocks all mouse events from view windows to avoid
  problems with user input while loading scenes which lead to wrongly
  drawn views
o added a texture coordinates editor (main menu "Special/Tags/Edit TexCoords")
o added a "Remove Tag!" menu to the standard Tag property GUI
o added "Show All" and "Hide All" menu entries to the main menu
o replaced "setNC"/"getNC"/"setNP"/"getNP" scripting interface commands
  with the new "setPnt"/"getPnt" commands
o added a new object type PolyMesh (polygonal mesh)
o the RIB import plugin now also imports "Polygons", "GeneralPolygons",
  "PointsPolygons", and "PointsGeneralPolygons"
o added a new tool for the PolyMesh object; "mergePo", that merges a bunch
  of PolyMesh objects (e.g. created by importing a poorly structured RIB)
  into a single PolyMesh object
o improved the object picking for shaded views
o improved the MFIO (3DMF) Import Plugin: it now outputs more detailed
  error messages, supports import of the following additional primitives:
  PolyLine, Triangle, General Polygon, Polygon, and TriGrid; and
  supports now output of all NURBCurve/NURBPatch providing objects.
o added shader parsing plugins: "ayslb" for Air, "ayslx" for Aqsis,
  "ayso" for RDC, "ayslo" for PRMan, and "ayslo3d" for 3Delight
o added a new object type "ConcatNC" that concatenates multiple NURBS
  curves or NURBS curve providing objects to a single NURBS curve
o added a new object type "Clone" that creates n instances of its child
  object and transforms each instance by a specified transformation
o Ayam now remembers the state of the toolbox (open/closed) and the
  object selection widget (listbox or treeview) in the ayamrc file
o added a "RenderMode" preference setting that allows to switch between
  two different methods of forcing a renderer to render to the screen (via
  RiDisplay, necessary for e.g. PRMan and RDC; or via command line argument)
o added a select renderer feature (main menu "Special/Select Renderer")
  that allows to switch between different renderers more easily; currently
  supported are BMRT2.5, BMRT2.6, Aqsis, Air, 3Delight, RDC, and PRMan
o reorganized the "Main/Special" menu by introduction of cascaded sub-menus
o changed calculation of bevels for the Extrude object; the bevels are
  now more evenly sized; this may, however, lead to problems with caps,
  because the bevels may overlap themselves in corners of the extrusion;
  thus, if cap generation fails, reduce the radius of the bevels
o all RenderGUI windows now automatically try to raise themself, should
  they be obscured, e.g. by the renderer window (but just one time)


[09. Jul 2002] Ayam 1.2:
========================
o bug fixes:
  - fixed color select buttons in preferences not updating on "load defaults"

    parameter curves (e.g. with B-Spline knot vectors)
  - fixed edit material feature selecting wrong objects under certain
    circumstances
  - fixed the TreeWidget generating sporadic error messages about
    a missing "_state" variable (using a backport of the bugfix for
    BWidgets bug #4324)
  - fixed Tcl error generated by the "Add" button of the preference
    setting "Main/Shaders", "Main/Scripts", and "Main/Plugins" (on
    Win32 and on Unix for path names with spaces).
o improved RIB export of quadric primitives with negative thetamax
o the mouse cursor now changes when the "alt rotate" action is in effect
o the modifier key for the "alt rotate" action is now configurable using
  "ayviewshortcuts(RotMod)" and "ayviewshortcuts(RotModKey)" respectively
o added a RIB import plugin
o added a new object type "PatchMesh"
o direct point editing now works for multiple selected objects
o resizing of the toolbox now works better for opaque resize
o shrink wrapping of the toolbox may now be turned off completely using
  "Preferences/Misc/ToolBoxShrink"
o added a checkbutton to the rendering GUI that controls ringing the
  bell when the rendering finishes
o added an object picking facility, you can now click in view windows
  to select objects (Bertrand Coconnier)
o the default action for view windows is now "Pick" (and not "None")
o added a reference card (a brief listing of all keyboard shortcuts)
  to the documentation
o improved shadow map creation: the RIB exporter now writes an
  additional file "<scene>.obj.rib", that contains the geometric
  primitives of the scene; furthermore, it is now possible to create
  shadow maps from custom lights (as long as the light shader contains
  arguments named "from", "to", or "coneangle")
o added shadow bias options to standard RiOption tag database
o the preference setting "RIB-Export/RIBFile" now allows a new special
  value "Scenefile" that works like "Scene" but strips the leading path
  from the scene file name (required by new shadow map RIB creation scheme)
o added a new tag type "TC" that holds texture coordinates
o the tag property GUI now displays just a certain number of characters
  from a tag value (this is adjustable via the new hidden preference
  setting "MaxTagLen")
o the edit tag dialogue is now resizable
o added some default RiOptions and RiAttributes to the default database
o improved the RiOptions and RiAttributes GUIs: they are now resizable
  and load the first value from the list of default values immediately
o added support for libslxargs; libslxargs may be used as replacement
  for libslcargs on platforms like MacOS X
o added drawing of a background image to view windows
o added two new component types to the MetaBalls custom object:
  cube and custom
o prepared some plugins to be combined statically into the binary
o added a show shortcuts feature to the main help menu
o improved the installation procedure
o the "UndoLevels" preference setting allows the undo system to be
  switched off completely using the special value "-1" now

o added auto-scrolling to property with focus (<Tab> scrolls the property GUI)
o added "Scene changed!" warning requester to various scene destroying
  operations, like "File/New"
o added MetaBalls custom object
o light objects are now drawn in a yellow color, when not selected
o "File/New" now reloads the working environment scene and clears the
  current filename
o added grid selection icon and menu to view window menu bar
o "File/Save(As)" now adds filenames to the most recently used list too
o added "Special/Toggle Toolbox" menu entry to open/close the toolbox window

  multiple points
o added "Help/Help on object" that directly displays the documentation
  of the selected type of object
o the preferences dialogue now comes up more smoothly
o added "Edit/Material" feature that finds the material object of a geometric
  object and selects it for editing (or creates and connects a new material)

  enable easier rendering of the example scenes
o RIB-Export: no archives are created for instances of objects that
  would not be exported anyway
o added a little label to the rendering GUI that displays the rendering time
o Due to a flaw in the design of the file format, Ayam 1.0b4 and below
  will not read Ayam 1.1 files. On the other hand, Ayam 1.1 reads files
  from 1.0b4 and below just fine.


[02. Oct 2001] Ayam 1.0 beta4:
==============================
o bug fixes:
  - Skin does not crash in interpolation mode, if two identical curves
    are present.
  - Weight edit does not crash anymore, if no objects are selected.
  - Tree Drag-and-Drop could crash Ayam when root object was dragged
    to certain targets.
  - Reading a scene via MostRecentlyUsed list sets internal scene
    filename correctly now.
  - Improved picking of points with arrows (e.g. last point of a NURBS curve).
  - Shading with material color (preference setting "UseMatColor") is now
    working for all objects.
  - Finally? fixed orientation detection routine for 2D curves, thus
    improving automatic cap generation for various object types.

o 3DMF import/export plugin revived.
o Preferences dialog looks much nicer now (uses a notebook for
  category selection, "Shaders" GUI-element uses the tooltip
  mechanism to display all paths of the entry at once now).
o Direct rendering of views creates a small GUI consisting of
  a progressbar and a cancel button (to stop the rendering!) now.
  Use "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderUI" to enable and "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderPT"
  to configure.
  This is disabled on Win32, since Tcl is not able to execute a kill
  program on this platform.
o Some User-Interface-Elements (of property GUIs) allow default
  values now.
o Added object type "Cap", that creates a cap from planar
  NURBS curves.
o Added automatic loading of custom objects when reading Ayam
  scene files.
