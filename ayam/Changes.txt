[CVS, 28. 07. 2002]:
o bug fixes:
  - fixed memory leaks in the shadow map RIB export module
  - fixed ICurves crash for length 2
  - fixed insert and delete point action errors for drag mouse events
o added a permanent preview feature; a constantly open RIB stream
  to a (fast) RenderMan renderer like rgl immediately displays all
  changes in the scene without the need to repeatedly hit "Ctrl-r" and
  close the preview window again
o the "TclPrecision" preference setting has been moved to the "Misc"
  preferences section
o added balloon help for all preference settings
o added a "Locale" preference setting and a locale system, that allows to
  display language specific balloon help texts (german translations of
  various balloon help texts provided initially)
o the coordinate system (the root object) now also draws axis names (x, y, z)

[09. 07. 2002] Ayam1.2:
o bug fixes:
  - fixed color select buttons in preferences not updating on "load defaults"
  - fixed missing RiSolidBegin/End for spheres with thetamax != 360
  - fixed RiAttribute tags not exporting when attached to material objects
  - fixed broken integer RiOption and RiAttribute declarations
  - fixed broken Camera property GUI of the Camera object
  - fixed broken "-h" command line option
  - fixed memory leaks in the Skin notification callback, while reading
    scenes, while clearing scenes, and while opening/closing view windows
  - fixed error connecting instances while loading certain scenes
  - fixed grid menu button not updating when switching a view to perspective
  - fixed writing of preferences and deleting of temporary files when the
    main window is closed to quit Ayam
  - fixed rotate about modeling action not redrawing all views
  - fixed direct point editing action crashing when the selection is
    changed or some points are selected (tagged), while the coordinate
    requester is open.
  - fixed incorrect side caps for revolve objects from certain open
    parameter curves (e.g. with B-Spline knot vectors)
  - fixed edit material feature selecting wrong objects under certain
    circumstances
  - fixed the TreeWidget generating sporadic error messages about
    a missing "_state" variable (using a backport of the bugfix for
    BWidgets bug #4324)
  - fixed Tcl error generated by the "Add" button of the preference
    setting "Main/Shaders", "Main/Scripts", and "Main/Plugins" (on
    Win32 and on Unix for path names with spaces).
o improved RIB export of quadric primitives with negative thetamax
o the mouse cursor now changes when the "alt rotate" action is in effect
o the modifier key for the "alt rotate" action is now configurable using
  "ayviewshortcuts(RotMod)" and "ayviewshortcuts(RotModKey)" respectively
o added a RIB import plugin
o added a new object type "PatchMesh"
o direct point editing now works for multiple selected objects
o resizing of the toolbox now works better for opaque resize
o shrink wrapping of the toolbox may now be turned off completely using
  "Preferences/Misc/ToolBoxShrink"
o added a checkbutton to the rendering GUI that controls ringing the
  bell when the rendering finishes

  to select objects (Bertrand Coconnier)
o the default action for view windows is now "Pick" (and not "None")
o added a reference card (a brief listing of all keyboard shortcuts)
  to the documentation
o improved shadow map creation: the RIB exporter now writes an
  additional file "<scene>.obj.rib", that contains the geometric
  primitives of the scene; furthermore, it is now possible to create
  shadow maps from custom lights (as long as the light shader contains
  arguments named "from", "to", or "coneangle")
o added shadow bias options to standard RiOption tag database
o the preference setting "RIB-Export/RIBFile" now allows a new special
  value "Scenefile" that works like "Scene" but strips the leading path
  from the scene file name (required by new shadow map RIB creation scheme)
o added a new tag type "TC" that holds texture coordinates
o the tag property GUI now displays just a certain number of characters
  from a tag value (this is adjustable via the new hidden preference
  setting "MaxTagLen")
o the edit tag dialogue is now resizable
o added some default RiOptions and RiAttributes to the default database
o improved the RiOptions and RiAttributes GUIs: they are now resizable
  and load the first value from the list of default values immediately
o added support for libslxargs; libslxargs may be used as replacement
  for libslcargs on platforms like MacOS X
o added drawing of a background image to view windows
o added two new component types to the MetaBalls custom object:
  cube and custom
o prepared some plugins to be combined statically into the binary
o added a show shortcuts feature to the main help menu
o improved the installation procedure
o the "UndoLevels" preference setting allows the undo system to be
  switched off completely using the special value "-1" now

o added "Scene changed!" warning requester to various scene destroying
  operations, like "File/New"
o added MetaBalls custom object
o light objects are now drawn in a yellow color, when not selected
o "File/New" now reloads the working environment scene and clears the
  current filename
o added grid selection icon and menu to view window menu bar
o "File/Save(As)" now adds filenames to the most recently used list too
o added "Special/Toggle Toolbox" menu entry to open/close the toolbox window
o added some example scripts to the documentation

  layout of the buttons adapting to these changes
o added "CreateMP" option to NURBS curves that inhibits creation of
  multiple points
o added "Help/Help on object" that directly displays the documentation
  of the selected type of object
o the preferences dialogue now comes up more smoothly
o added "Edit/Material" feature that finds the material object of a geometric
  object and selects it for editing (or creates and connects a new material)

  would not be exported anyway
o added a little label to the rendering GUI that displays the rendering time
o Due to a flaw in the design of the file format, Ayam1.0b4 and below
  will not read Ayam1.1 files. On the other hand, Ayam1.1 reads files
  from 1.0b4 and below just fine.


[02. 10. 2001] Ayam1.0 beta4:
o bug fixes:
  - Skin does not crash in interpolation mode, if two identical curves
    are present.
  - Weight edit does not crash anymore, if no objects are selected.
  - Tree Drag-and-Drop could crash Ayam when root object was dragged
    to certain targets.
  - Reading a scene via MostRecentlyUsed list sets internal scene
    filename correctly now.
  - Improved picking of points with arrows (e.g. last point of a NURBS curve).
  - Shading with material color (preference setting "UseMatColor") is now
    working for all objects.
  - Finally? fixed orientation detection routine for 2D curves, thus
    improving automatic cap generation for various object types.
  - Views do not get wrong settings while loading scenes or fast switching
    of view windows on slower machines anymore.
  - "forAll", "forAllT", and consequently "Edit/Paste Property" now work
    correctly for nested object hierarchies.
  - ...
o 3DMF import/export plugin revived.
o Preferences dialog looks much nicer now (uses a notebook for
  category selection, "Shaders" GUI-element uses the tooltip
  mechanism to display all paths of the entry at once now).
o Direct rendering of views creates a small GUI consisting of
  a progressbar and a cancel button (to stop the rendering!) now.
  Use "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderUI" to enable and "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderPT"
  to configure.
  This is disabled on Win32, since Tcl is not able to execute a kill
  program on this platform.
o Some User-Interface-Elements (of property GUIs) allow default
  values now.
o Added new object type "Cap", that creates a cap from planar
  NURBS curves.
