  - fixed view-undo problems (e.g. not setting window titles correctly)
  - added missing declarations for some BMRT specific attributes/options
  - fixed focus handling for set_gridsize and set_fov dialogues
  - fixed unnecessary saving of undo states

  operations, like "File/New"

[02. 10. 2001] Ayam1.0 beta4:
o bug fixes:
  - Skin does not crash in interpolation mode, if two identical curves
    are present.
  - Weight edit does not crash anymore, if no objects are selected.
  - Tree Drag-and-Drop could crash Ayam when root object was dragged
    to certain targets.
  - Reading a scene via MostRecentlyUsed list sets internal scene
    filename correctly now.
  - Improved picking of points with arrows (e.g. last point of a NURBS curve).
  - Shading with material color (preference setting "UseMatColor") is now
    working for all objects.
  - Finally? fixed orientation detection routine for 2D curves, thus
    improving automatic cap generation for various object types.
  - Views do not get wrong settings while loading scenes or fast switching
    of view windows on slower machines anymore.
  - "forAll", "forAllT", and consequently "Edit/Paste Property" now work
    correctly for nested object hierarchies.
  - ...
o 3DMF import/export plugin revived.
o Preferences dialog looks much nicer now (uses a notebook for
  category selection, "Shaders" GUI-element uses the tooltip
  mechanism to display all paths of the entry at once now).
o Direct rendering of views creates a small GUI consisting of
  a progressbar and a cancel button (to stop the rendering!) now.
  Use "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderUI" to enable and "Prefs/RIB-Export/RenderPT"
  to configure.
  This is disabled on Win32, since Tcl is not able to execute a kill
  program on this platform.
o Some User-Interface-Elements (of property GUIs) allow default
  values now.
o Added new object type "Cap", that creates a cap from planar
  NURBS curves.
o Added automatic loading of custom objects when reading Ayam
  scene files.
o Implemented automatic cap generation for the Sweep object.
o Implemented automatic cap generation for the Skin object.
o Improved "Direct-Point-Edit" mode, you may select different points
  now, while the coordinate requester is open. Additionally, it is
  checking now, whether notification and redraws are really necessary.
o Added keyboard shortcuts to Most-Recently-Used file menu entries.
o SDK reworked.
o Plugins moved to "plugins" directory.
