[INSTALL, 8. Jul 2002]

To install Ayam into your system edit the Makefile to your liking
switch to root and do a:
>make install
you can uninstall Ayam as well using:
>make uninstall

By default, Ayam will install to /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable,
/usr/local/ayam/lib for the plugins and accompanying Tcl files, and
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH variable.
Be sure to also add "." or "/usr/local/ayam/lib" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/lib/Makefile uninstall
