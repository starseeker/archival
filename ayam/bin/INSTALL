1. General Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

To install Ayam into your system edit the Makefile to your liking
switch to root and do a:
>make install
you can uninstall Ayam as well using:
>make uninstall

By default, Ayam will install to /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable,
/usr/local/ayam/lib for the plugins and accompanying Tcl files, and
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Be sure to also add "." or "/usr/local/ayam/lib" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/ayam/lib/Makefile uninstall

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
>make -n install
or
>make -n uninstall
first.


2. IRIX Specific Information
----------------------------

o On IRIX there is currently no ayslx plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing ayslx.so file, that occur during the installation.
o On IRIX there is currently no aysdr plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing aysdr.so file, that occur during the installation.
o On IRIX you have to adapt the variable LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


3. Mac OS X Specific Information
--------------------------------

The Mac OS X binary of Ayam was compiled on the SourceForge compile farm
on Mac OS X 10.1 using X11. Support for plugins has been switched off.
There are no plugins distributed with this release.
The MetaObj custom object is statically compiled into the binary.
Because BMRT is not available on Mac OS X, this binary has been compiled
without libslcargs and will scan .xml shader description files created
by sl2xml from the K-3D project only.
I am not able to test this binary on my own! The main tester (Daniel Amor)
reported that it will only run, when started from an xterm.
