1. General Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

To install Ayam into your system switch to root, cd to ayam/bin and enter:
>make install

By default, Ayam will install to "/usr/local/ayam".
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable, plugins, and scripts,
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation, and
/usr/local/ayam/scn for the example scenes.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Use ayam.sh to start the application or be sure to add "." or
"/usr/local/ayam/bin/plugins" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable. Otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall

The Makefile may be adapted on systems where "/usr/local/ayam" is not
a feasible prefix directory, just change the PREFIX variable.
Note that PREFIX must end in an Ayam specific directory; spreading the
executables, plugins, Tcl scripts, documentation, and example scenes across
the file system is not supported.

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
>make -n install
or
>make -n uninstall
first.

Ayam also integrates with Unix desktop environments.
The next steps need the xdg-utils from the Portland project to be installed.

To install a system wide applications menu entry, enter:
>make sysmenu

The next commands should not be run as root!

To add a desktop launcher to the current users desktop, enter:
>make desktop

If Ayam was installed to a user specific directory (e.g. on systems
without root access), the following two targets add a user application
menu entry and file type:
>make menu
>make filetype


2. Linux Specific Information
-----------------------------

o The shader parsing plugins in this release were compiled with the
  following versions of the renderers: ayslo3d: 3Delight 2.0.2,
  ayslx: Aqsis 0.9.0, aysdr: Pixie 1.3.3, ayso: RDC 3.3.5,
  ayslo: PRMan 11.5


3. IRIX Specific Information
----------------------------

o On IRIX there is currently no aysdr plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing aysdr.so file, that occur during the installation.
o On IRIX there is currently no aycsg plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing aycsg.so file, that occur during the installation.
o On IRIX you have to adapt the variable LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
o The shader parsing plugins in this release were compiled with the
  following versions of the renderers: ayslx: Aqsis 0.9.0,
  ayslo3d: 3Delight 1.0.6 MIPS4, ayso: RDC 3.3.5 MIPS3,
  ayslo: PRMan 3.8.0.6 MIPS3


4. Mac OS X (X11) Specific Information
--------------------------------------

o The Mac OS X binary of Ayam was compiled on the SourceForge compile farm
  on Mac OS X 10.1 using X11. Therefore, you need X11 to run this binary.
o Because BMRT is not available on Mac OS X, this binary has been compiled
  without libslcargs and will scan .xml shader description files created
  by sl2xml from the K-3D project only (if no shader parsing plugin is
  loaded).
o At the moment, the only shader parsing plugins available on Mac OS X are
  ayslo3d and aysdr. The ayslo3d plugin was compiled with 3Delight 2.0.0.
  The aysdr plugin was compiled with Pixie 1.3.3, with object files kindly
  provided by George Harker.
o On Mac OS X there is currently no aycsg plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing aycsg.so file, that occur during the installation.


5. Mac OS X (Aqua) Specific Information
---------------------------------------

On Mac OS X (Aqua), the installation is being done by simply dragging
the Ayam.app application bundle to the system or user applications
directory using the Finder.
