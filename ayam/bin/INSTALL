1. General Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

To install Ayam into your system edit the Makefile to your liking
switch to root and do a:
>make install
you can uninstall Ayam as well using:
>make uninstall

By default, Ayam will install to /usr/local/ayam.
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable,
/usr/local/ayam/lib for the plugins and accompanying Tcl files, and
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Be sure to also add "." or "/usr/local/ayam/lib" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable, otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
>make -f /usr/local/ayam/lib/Makefile uninstall

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
>make -n install
or
>make -n uninstall
first.


2. Linux Specific Information
-----------------------------

o The shader parsing plugins in this release were compiled with the
  following versions of the renderers: ayslo3d: 3Delight 2.0.2,
  ayslx: Aqsis 0.9.0, aysdr: Pixie 1.3.3, ayso: RDC 3.3.5,
  ayslo: PRMan 11.5


3. IRIX Specific Information
----------------------------

o On IRIX there is currently no aysdr plug-in. You may safely ignore the
  warnings about a missing aysdr.so file, that occur during the installation.
o On IRIX you have to adapt the variable LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
o The shader parsing plugins in this release were compiled with the
  following versions of the renderers: ayslx: Aqsis 0.9.0,
  ayslo3d: 3Delight 1.0.6 MIPS4, ayso: RDC 3.3.5 MIPS3,
  ayslo: PRMan 3.8.0.6 MIPS3


4. Mac OS X Specific Information
--------------------------------

o The Mac OS X binary of Ayam was compiled on the SourceForge compile farm
  on Mac OS X 10.1 using X11. Therefore, you need X11 to run this binary.
o Because BMRT is not available on Mac OS X, this binary has been compiled
  without libslcargs and will scan .xml shader description files created
  by sl2xml from the K-3D project only (if no shader parsing plugin is
  loaded).
o At the moment, the only shader parsing plugins available on Mac OS X are
  ayslo3d and aysdr. The ayslo3d plugin was compiled with 3Delight 2.0.0.
  The aysdr plugin was compiled with Pixie 1.3.3, with object files kindly
  provided by George Harker.
o I am not able to test this binary on my own! The main tester (Daniel Amor)
  reported that it will only run, when started from an xterm.
