Setup instructions for Ayam (Unix only)
---------------------------------------

The executable of Ayam is located in the directory named "bin".
You can use Ayam directly from where you unpacked, or install it
into your system. If you want to install, just follow the instructions
in the file "bin/INSTALL" first.

Before you start modelling with Ayam, you should set it up
properly. The following things have to be done for that:

  1. Saving preferences
  2. Determining type of window manager
  3. Setting up shaders	
  4. Creating and saving a working environment

Do not worry about any error messages in red color, that appeared
in the console on first startup. We are going to fix them now.


1. Saving preferences
---------------------

The preference settings are automatically saved when you
leave the application.

The preferences are saved to the file: "~/.ayamrc"

You can change the filename of the preference settings
using the environment variable "AYAMRC".
How do you set an environment variable?

add to your profile:
 csh/tcsh: setenv AYAMRC /home/user/.myayamrc
 bash/ksh/zsh: export AYAMRC=/home/user/.myayamrc

You have to restart the shell and Ayam in order for these changes to
take effect.

You can switch off automatic saving of preferences on exit in the
preference settings (Pref: "Main/AutoSavePrefs").
If you switched off AutoSavePrefs, you can force saving of the
preferences using the menu entry "File/Save Prefs".


2. Determining type of window manager
-------------------------------------

If you fail to correctly determine the type of your window
manager, the geometry of the main window and the toolbox
will be wrong after restart of Ayam. Furthermore, the main
window may jump, each time a new property is selected.
This is because, unfortunately, different X window managers report
different values for the geometries of top level windows, some include
the decoration, some do not.

If the main window jumps when you select the first property
of the "Root" object your WM is "twm-compatible".
To check this, just start Ayam, click on "Root" in the tree view,
then on "RiOptions" in the listbox to the right and watch
your main window.
If it jumps downward, you should set "TwmCompat" to "on" in the
preferences!


3. Setting up shaders
---------------------

What are shaders? For the moment, we can safely assume that
shaders are small files that carry material descriptions.
Some example shaders come with your RenderMan compatible renderer
(e.g. BMRT), but you may also create your own of course.
Currently, Ayam can only work with shaders that have been
compiled with "slc" from BMRT, so you should get and
install BMRT http://www.exluna.com/.
Now you need to point Ayam to the directories where your slc-compiled
shaders reside in order to use them with the material
objects in Ayam.
This is done using the preference setting "Main/Shaders".
Just open the preferences, enter the appropriate paths (separated by ":")
into the string entry labeled "Shaders".
Now press the "Scan Shaders" button below and watch the console for
error messages.


4. Creating and saving a working environment
--------------------------------------------

The working environment is simply an almost empty Ayam scene file.
This file just contains the specification of some view windows.
It is loaded automatically on every start of Ayam and presents you
with a standard working environment, consisting of e.g. a traditional
3-view layout (Front-, Side-, and Perspective-View).

How do you create such a file?

o Start Ayam.
o Open and arrange as many views as you like using the
  menu entry "Create/View".
  [If Ayam crashes or blocks during opening of a view
   something with your OpenGL setup is seriously broken.
   Fix this, then return here.]
o Save the environment using the main menu entry
  "Special/Save Environment". This will save the environment
  to the file given in the preference setting "Main/EnvFile".
  The default setting is "~/.ayam2view.ay". You may of course
  change the setting in "Main/EnvFile" to your liking before
  saving the environment.
  Do not switch off the preference setting "Main/LoadEnv",
  as this would inhibit automatic loading of the working
  environment on startup.
  If the preference setting "Main/NewLoadsEnv" is enabled, the
  working environment will also be read, if you clear the scene
  using the main menu entry "File/New".

Quit the application and start it again; then
download "Tutorial #1" and do it.

End of setup instructions.
