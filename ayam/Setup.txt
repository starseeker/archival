Setup instructions for Ayam
---------------------------

The executable of Ayam is located in the directory named "bin".
On Win32 platforms (Windows 95 - Windows 2000) always use the
accompanying shell script "ayam.bat" to start Ayam.
On first start of this executable, the following things have to be done:

  1. Saving preferences
  2. Determining type of window manager (UNIX only)
  3. Setting up shaders	
  4. Creating and saving a working environment

Do not worry about any error messages in red color, that appear
in the console on first startup. We are going to fix them now.


1. Saving preferences
---------------------

Preference settings (Menu: "Edit/Preferences") are normally
automatically saved on exit of the application.
You can switch off automatic saving of preferences on exit in the
preference settings (Pref: "Main/AutoSavePrefs").
If you switched off AutoSavePrefs, you can force saving of the
preferences using the menu entry "File/Save Prefs".

The preferences (including the geometry of the main window and the toolbox
and some other stuff) are saved to the file:
UNIX: "~/.ayamrc"
Win32: "$(HOME)/ayamrc" if the environment variable "HOME" exists
       "$(TEMP)/ayamrc" else

The following steps need to be done if you (for some reason)
do not like it that way, or the preferences end up in silly
places (e.g. Win95 is setting your $(HOME) to "C:/", so that
the preferences end up in "C:/ayamrc"...).
However, if anything is fine with you, just skip to Step 2 now.

You can change the filename of the preference settings
using the environment variable "AYAMRC".
How do you set an environment variable?

UNIX: add to your profile:
 csh/tcsh: setenv AYAMRC /home/user/.myayamrc
 bash/ksh/zsh: export AYAMRC=/home/user/.myayamrc

Win32: edit the script "ayam.bat":
 o remove the leading ";" from the line ";SET AYAMRC=C:/ayam/myayamrc"
 o and change the path to a more appropriate setting

 Alternatively:

 WinNT/2000: open Start/Settings/Control-Panel/System/Environment
             o Add a new Variable "AYAMRC"
             o Set it e.g. to C:/ayam/myayamrc
 Win95/98/ME: add to the file "C:/autoexec.bat" the line:
              SET AYAMRC=C:/ayam/myayamrc

Remember: NEVER use backslashes (\) in any path or filename you enter to Ayam.

You have to restart Ayam in order for these changes to take effect.


2. Determining type of window manager (UNIX only)
-------------------------------------------------

These steps need just to be performed on UNIX.
For Win32 skip to step 3.

Unfortunately, different window managers on UNIX report
different geometries of top level windows, some include
the decoration, some do not..
If the main window jumps when you select the first property
of the "Root" object your WM is "twm-compatible".
To check this, just click on "Root" in the tree view,
then on "RiOptions" in the listbox to the right and watch
your main window.
If it jumps downward, you should set "TwmCompat" to "on" in the
preferences!
If you fail to correctly determine the type of your window
manager, the geometry of the main window and the toolbox
will be wrong after restart of Ayam. Furthermore, the main
window may jump, each time a new property is selected.


3. Setting up shaders
---------------------

What are shaders? For the moment, we can safely assume that
shaders are small files that carry material descriptions.
Shaders come with your RenderMan compatible renderer (e.g. BMRT),
but you may also create your own of course.
Currently, Ayam can only work with shaders that have been
compiled with "slc" from BMRT, so you should get and
install BMRT from http://www.exluna.com/.
You need to point Ayam to the directories where your slc-compiled
shaders reside in order to use them with the material
objects in Ayam.
This is done using the preference setting "Main/Shaders".
Just open the preferences, enter the appropriate paths
into the string entry (separated by ":" on UNIX and ";" on Win32),
and then press "Scan Shaders".
Watch the console for error messages.

Remember: NEVER use backslashes (\) in any path or filename you enter to Ayam.

4. Creating and saving a working environment
--------------------------------------------

o Open and arrange as many views as you like using the
  menu entry "Create/View".
  [If Ayam crashes or blocks during opening of a view
   something with your OpenGL setup is seriously broken.
   Fix this, then return here.]
o Save the scene using the menu entry "File/Save as" to
  the filename that is given in the preference setting
  "Main/EnvFile". The default setting is "~/.ayam2view.ay".
  Change it as you like, but remember to save preferences
  in order to let this change take effect.
  Do not switch off the preference setting "Main/LoadEnv",
  as this would inhibit automatic loading of the working
  environment on startup.


Quit the application and start it again; then
download "Tutorial #1" and do it.

End of setup instructions.
