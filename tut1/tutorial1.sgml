<title>Ayam Tutorial #1
<author>Randolf Schultz <tt>(rschultz@informatik.uni-rostock.de)</tt>
<date>26. Jul 2004
<abstract>
This is the first tutorial for Ayam, a free 3D
modeling environment for the RenderMan interface.
This version of the tutorial is
tailored to version 1.7 (and up) of Ayam.
We will do nothing fancy in this first tutorial, just a wooden
sphere on a gray ground.
But even if you feel like you know how to do such a simple thing 
with any modeling environment, please read on, as this tutorial gives
also some important general handling instructions for Ayam.
</abstract>

<sect>Ayam User Interface
<p>
The Ayam user interface consists of three types of windows:
the main window, a toolbox, and view windows.
Please note that whenever keyboard shortcuts are mentioned in the following
sections, they belong to a certain window that has to be activated
before the key press. Otherwise you risk the keyboard shortcut being sent
to the wrong window and possibly cause unwanted actions.<p>
Thus, and because of its multiple window user interface, Ayam is most
comfortably used with a window system where a window is automatically
activated when the mouse pointer enters it (this policy is often
called "focus follows mouse"). Since version 1.4, Ayam can
automatically activate the right windows if the preference
setting <tt>AutoFocus</tt> is enabled.

<sect1>The Main Window
<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/main.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/main.gif">
<caption>The Main Window</caption>
</figure><p>
The figure shows a snapshot of the main window with 3 sections marked:
<enum>
<item>The <bf/Objects/ section lets you select objects.
As you can see in the figure, there are already some objects
in the current scene, and an object called <tt/"Root"/
is currently selected.
<item>The <bf/properties listbox/ shows the properties of a single
selected object, the selected object (<tt/"Root"/) has 4 properties:
<tt/"RiOptions"/, <tt/"Tags"/, <tt/"Atmosphere"/, and <tt/"Imager"/.
You may select just one of the properties.
The <bf/property GUI/ lets you modify the settings of the selected
property (<tt/"RiOptions"/ in this case). Never forget to press
the <tt/"Apply"/ button to make your changes actually happen.
<item>The <bf/console/ is for text output (warnings, error messages)
and input. Input should be considered a feature for the advanced
Ayam user. We will not use it in this first tutorial.
In case you accidentally activated the console by clicking into it
(it will then display a blinking cursor and a black rim),
remember that you have to press <tt/&lt;Shift-Tab&gt;/ in order to enable
the keyboard shortcuts to the main menu entries again.
</enum>

<sect1>The View Window
<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/viewwin.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/viewwin.gif">
<caption>A View Window</caption>
</figure><p>
This figure shows a view window, which displays currently
nothing but a small coordinate system, that marks the origin of
the world. The axes are color coded (red x, green y, blue z).
<p>
Now take a look at the title bar of the window.
It reads <tt/"View1 - Front - Pick"/.
<tt/"View1"/ means it is your first view (you can have more views
but we will not make use of multiple views in this first tutorial),
<tt/"Front"/ is the type of the view.
Finally, <tt/"Pick"/ means that there is currently no special
modeling action activated in this view.
Instead, the currently activated action allows you to pick (select)
objects with your mouse.
<p>
But back to the type. The type of a view is an important property
of a view, because it limits the scope of all modeling actions in
this view. In a view of type <tt/"Front"/ you can move objects in the
direction of the x axis or y axis, but never in the direction of the
z axis. You have to switch to a different type of view (e.g. <tt/"Side"/)
to move an object in the direction of the z axis.<p>
There is an easy way to switch the type of a view, simply use
one of the following keyboard shortcuts: <tt/&lt;Ctrl-f&gt;/ (switch to front),
<tt/&lt;Ctrl-s&gt;/ (switch to side), <tt/&lt;Ctrl-t&gt;/ (switch to top).

<sect1>The Tool Box
<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/tools.ps" height="5cm">
<img src="pics/tools.gif">
<caption>The Tool Box Window</caption>
</figure><p>
The figure shows the tool box window. The first two
rows of buttons start
interactive modeling actions that transform objects. Note, that
there is a tool tip for each button, that is activated when the
mouse pointer is left standing for a while over a button. This
tool tip also teaches the current keyboard shortcut for the action
that is associated with the button.
The second two rows of buttons allow the creation of solid
primitives.<p>

In this tutorial we will mainly use buttons of these two sections,
the other sections are for more advanced modeling tasks (with e.g. NURBS).

<sect>Setting up Ayam<label id="setup">
<p>
If you followed all steps in the file <tt/"Setup.txt"/ or
<tt/"SetupWin32.htm"/
already and feel like you set up Ayam the right way you might as well
skip to section <ref id="ground" name="Creating the Ground"> now.
Otherwise follow these instructions:
<p>
Please get, install, and setup BMRT V2.6 before going on.
Note, that if you have a very old BMRT
(versions prior to 2.5) Ayam might not be able to work
correctly.
<p>
Before you start modeling you should make sure that Ayam
is set up correctly. Please take a look at the messages
that appear on startup in the console, red messages denote
serious errors that should be eliminated before going on.
<p>
However, you may ignore messages about a missing <tt/"ayamrc"/
file if you start Ayam the very first time.
<p>
In order to successfully complete this tutorial,
the preference setting <tt/Shaders/ should point to the
shaders directory of BMRT (shaders are files with the
extension <tt/".slc"/). But, what is a shader
you ask. Well, for the moment we can safely assume that
a shader is a file carrying a material description.
It is actually much more than that but we really do not
have to worry about this now. But, how do you set this up?
Simply select the menu entry <tt/"Preferences"/ in the <tt/"Edit"/
menu. A new window pops up as shown in this figure:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/prefs.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/prefs.gif">
<caption>preferences dialog</caption>
</figure>
<p>
You need to adjust the first setting <tt/"Shaders"/ in the
<tt/"Main"/ section
to point to the directory, where the BMRT2.6 shaders are stored.
If it already does, fine. If not, set it.
You can enter the list of path names to your shaders manually,
separated by a <tt/":"/ on Unix and by a <tt/";"/ on Windows, or you
can use the <tt/"Add"/ button. If you use the <tt/"Add"/ button
simply select a file in the directory of shaders
you would like to add.
Now press the <tt/"Apply"/ button below. After that,
press the <tt/"Scan Shaders!"/ button right below the
<tt/"Shaders"/ entry and watch the console for error messages.
It will tell you how many shaders have been found.
Note: on the Win32 platform you probably will have to delete
all files with the extension <tt/"intelnt.slc"/ to make
parsing of shaders work.
Now close the preferences window by clicking on the <tt/"Ok"/-button.
<p>
When Ayam has been started for the very first time there is
no view opened. You may open a first view (we do not need
more than one in this tutorial) by clicking
on the camera button in the tool box window.
If you are unsure simply wait for the tool tip to appear,
then browse through the buttons until the tool tip reads <tt/"new View"/.
If Ayam crashes or blocks now, something is terribly wrong with your
OpenGL setup and you should fix it. If you use a self compiled binary
and Ayam crashes while opening a view this is a sure sign, that
the Tcl/Tk version you used while compiling and the version Ayam uses
at runtime mismatch, please re-read and follow the compilation
instructions more carefully.
<p>
Now we are set, and may start modeling.

<sect>Creating the Ground<label id="ground">
<p>
The ground of our scene will be built from a simple box object,
which we create using the tool box.<p>
<bf/Step 1:/ Click on the box icon in the second section of the tool box,
this is the first icon in this section. If you are unsure
simply wait for the tool tip to appear, then browse through the
buttons until the tool tip reads <tt/"create Box"/.<p>
Your view should now display a box like in figure 5:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/gbox1.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/gbox1.gif">
<caption>the ground box, step 1</caption>
</figure><p>
This box (shaped like a cube) is surely not suitable as ground.
We change its shape to a large flat slab using the
<tt/Transformations/ property of this object:<p>
<bf/Step 2:/ Go to the <bf/main window/ and click on
<tt/Transformations/ in the <bf/properties listbox/.<p>
<bf/Step 3:/ Change the entries for <tt/"Scale_X/", <tt/"Scale_Y"/, and
<tt/"Scale_Z"/ to <tt/"100"/, <tt/"0.1"/, and <tt/"100"/ respectively.
You may have to scroll
the <bf/property GUI/ down to see the scale entries. You may
jump from one entry to the next using the <tt/&lt;Tab&gt;/ key.
The main window should now look like in figure 6:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/maingb1.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/maingb1.gif">
<caption>scaling using the transformations property</caption>
</figure><p>
<bf/Step 4:/ Press the <tt/"Apply"/ button.
The view should display an image like figure 7 (we are looking at the
slab from a side):<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/gbox2.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/gbox2.gif">
<caption>the ground box, step 2</caption>
</figure><p>

<sect>Creating the Sphere
<p>
Our next goal is to create the sphere.<p>
<bf/Step 1:/ Click on the sphere icon in the second section of
the tool box. If you are unsure which button to choose
wait for the tool tip to appear, then browse through the
buttons until the tool tip reads <tt/"create Sphere"/.<p>
Your view should now display the box and a sphere as in figure 8:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/sphere1.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/sphere1.gif">
<caption>creating the sphere</caption>
</figure><p>
As you can see the sphere is not lying on the slab but rather sticking
in it. We will raise it using an interactive modeling action now.<p>
<bf/Step 2:/ Click on the move icon in the tool box.
This is the leftmost button in the upper row.
Take a look at the title bar of the view window, it should read
<tt/"View1 - Front - Move"/.
Now click into the window drag the mouse and move the sphere upwards until
the view displays a similar image as that of figure 9:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/sphere2.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/sphere2.gif">
<caption>moving the sphere</caption>
</figure><p>

<sect>Adding Material
<p>
Now we will add a material to the sphere to make it "wooden".
<p>
<bf/Step 1:/ Go back to the <bf/main window/.
Make sure that the sphere object is still selected,
so that the new material will be associated with it.
Now create a material object using the menu entry
<tt>"Edit/Material"</tt> (you can also use the keyboard shortcut
<tt>&lt;Ctrl+m&gt;</tt>). 
A dialog box (see figure 10) will pop up, asking you for a name for this
new material object; enter "wood" and press the <tt/"Ok"/-button:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/crtmat.ps" height="1.5cm">
<img src="pics/crtmat.gif">
<caption>creating a material object</caption>
</figure>
<p>
<bf/Step 2:/ The newly created material object will immediately be
selected and display its properties in the <bf/properties listbox/.
Select the
<tt/"Surface"/ entry in the <bf/properties listbox/.
A new <bf/property GUI/ appears, as displayed in figure 11:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/wood1.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/wood1.gif">
<caption>setting a surface shader</caption>
</figure><p>
<bf/Step 3:/ Click on the <tt/"Set new Shader."/ button
in the <bf/property GUI/. A listbox pops up, see figure 12:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/popup.ps" height="4cm">
<img src="pics/popup.gif">
<caption>shader selection popup</caption>
</figure><p>
(If your listbox is displaying no entries at all
you probably have not set up Ayam properly, please go
back to section <ref id="setup" name="Setting up Ayam">.)<p>
<bf/Step 4:/ Select the <tt/"wood2"/ entry in the listbox,
it is probably the last one, so you have to scroll down.
Now press <tt/"Ok"/. The <bf/property GUI/ changes again; it displays
a lot of entries now, that are the parameters of the shader
<tt/"wood2"/ as shown in figure 13:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/wood2.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/wood2.gif">
<caption>the wood2 shader</caption>
</figure><p>
But we do not need to change anything here.<p>
<bf/Step 5:/ Press the <tt/"Apply"/ button.<p>

We do not need to set a material for the box, as the default material
in Ayam is <tt/"matte"/, which is sufficient for this tutorial.

<sect>Lighting the Scene
<p>
Now we will create and place a light source.
<p>
<bf/Step 1:/ Create a light source object by clicking
on the light bulb in the <bf/tool window/.
We will light the scene with a light source of type <tt/"Distant"/ which
is very easy to use.
For that, we have to change the type of the newly created light source:<p>
<bf/Step 2:/ Go to the <bf/main window/ and click on the
<tt/"LightAttr"/ entry in the
<bf/properties listbox/. A new <bf/property GUI/ appears,
as displayed in figure 14:
<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/light1.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/light1.gif">
<caption>setting light parameters</caption>
</figure>
<p>
<bf/Step 3:/ Change the type of the light source using the
first entry (the <tt/"Type"/ menubutton) in the <bf/property GUI/.
Change the type to <tt/"Distant"/.
<p>
<bf/Step 4:/ Press the <tt/"Apply"/ button.
The <bf/property GUI/ changes and display some new options,
related to the new type of the light source.
In the next step we enable shadow generation for our light source
(it is switched off by default!).
<p>
<bf/Step 5:/ Click on the <tt/"Shadows"/ checkbutton to turn it on.
<p>
<bf/Step 6:/ Press the <tt/"Apply"/ button. The light source is
now parameterized appropriately but it is lighting into the
wrong direction. We use the <tt/Transformations/
property again to make the lightsource light by a -45 degree angle
down.
<p>
<bf/Step 7:/ Click on the <tt/"Transformations"/ entry in the
<bf/properties listbox/. Change the <tt/"Rotate_X"/ entry to <tt/"-45"/
and press the <tt/"Apply"/ button. We will check what we have done
by looking at the scene from the side in the next step.<p>
<bf/Step 8:/ Go back to the <bf/view window/ and switch its type to
<tt/Side/ using the shortcut <tt/&lt;Ctrl-s&gt;/. It should show the
scene from the side as in figure 15:
<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/light2.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/light2.gif">
<caption>side view</caption>
</figure><p>
Do not worry about the fact that the light source seems to be located
in the origin of the scene. <tt/"Distant"/ light sources do not have a
distinctive point from which they are lighting. All that counts for
a <tt/"Distant"/ light is the direction and thus our light is now
parameterized correctly and we may render the scene in the next
section.

<sect>Rendering the Scene
<p>
Rendering a scene includes setup of the camera and invoking the
final renderer.<p>
<bf/Step 1:/ Switch the type of the view window to
<tt/"Perspective"/ using the shortcut <tt/&lt;Ctrl-p&gt;/.
The view changes as displayed in figure 16:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/persp.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/persp.gif">
<caption>perspective view</caption>
</figure><p>
We start a first test rendering now.<p>
<bf/Step 2:/ Start the BMRT-OpenGL previewer (rgl) using
the shortcut <tt/&lt;Ctrl-r&gt;/. The result should look like
figure 17:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/rgl.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/rgl.gif">
<caption>rgl preview</caption>
</figure><p>
(If Ayam now complains about rgl not being found, BMRT is not set
up correctly. Please read and execute the BMRT installation instructions
again, then return here.)
As you can see, the sphere is a bit too small and not centered.
We will fix this now.
You can get rid of the preview window using the <tt/&lt;Esc&gt;/ key.<p>
<bf/Step 3:/ Select the sphere in the <bf/main window/.<p>
<bf/Step 4:/ Go back to the view and press
<tt/&lt;Ctrl-o&gt;/.
This shortcuts changes the parameters of a view so that it displays
the center of the selected objects and adapts the zoom factor
of the view so that the selected objects are well sized.<p>
<bf/Step 5:/ Start the BMRT-raytracer (rendrib) using the
shortcut <tt/&lt;Ctrl-R&gt;/ (note the capital r; you have to press
Control, Shift, and r simultaneously!).
You have to wait a bit until the renderer finishes the image
as displayed in figure 18:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/rendrib.ps" height="6cm">
<img src="pics/rendrib.gif">
<caption>final rendering</caption>
</figure><p>

All done!<p>

Your homework for today:<p>
Make the lighting in this image more interesting with
a spotlight. Here is what to do (the tutorial should have
teached you how to execute the following tasks):<p>
<itemize>
<item>Select the light source.
<item>Change the type of the light source to <tt/"Spot"/.
<item>Change its <tt/"Intensity"/ to <tt/"150"/ and its <tt/"ConeAngle"/
to <tt/"15"/.
<item>Go back to the view and switch it to type <tt/"Side"/,
then move the light using an
interactive modeling action so that it lights the sphere
(the arrow of the light source should point directly onto the sphere
when you are finished).
If you do not move the light, it will probably be located inside
the box and not be able light anything!
<item>Select the sphere.
<item>Switch to a perspective view and adjust it properly using
the zoom to object feature.
<item>Render again.
</itemize>
The resulting image should look like figure 19:<p>
<figure loc="!ht">
<eps file="pics/homework.ps" height="6cm">

<caption>homework</caption>
