<p></p><a name='Introduction'><h1>Introduction</h1></a><p><em>(This document describes version 2.6)</em></p><p><strong>CHICKEN is a compiler that translates Scheme source files into C</strong>, which in turn can be fed to a C-compiler to generate a standalone executable.  An interpreter is also available and can be used as a scripting environment or for testing programs before compilation.</p><p>This package is distributed under the <strong>BSD license</strong> and as such is free to use and modify. </p><p>The method of compilation and the design of the runtime-system follow closely Henry Baker's <a href='http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html' class='external'>CONS Should Not CONS Its Arguments, Part II: Cheney on the M.T.A.</a> paper and expose a number of interesting properties:</p><ul><li>Consing (creation of data on the heap) is relatively inexpensive, because a generational garbage collection scheme is used, in which short-lived data structures are reclaimed extremely quickly.</li><li>Moreover, <tt>call-with-current-continuation</tt> is practically for free and CHICKEN does not suffer under any performance penalties if first-class continuations are used in complex ways.</li></ul><p>The generated C code is fully tail-recursive.</p><p>Some of the features supported by CHICKEN:</p><ul><li>SRFIs 0, 1, 2, 4, 6-19, 23, 25-31, 37-40, 42, 43, 45, 47, 55, 57, 60-63, 66, 69, 72, 78, 85 and 95.</li><li>Lightweight threads based on first-class continuations</li><li>Pattern matching with Andrew Wright's <tt>match</tt> package</li><li>Record structures</li><li>Extended comment- and string-literal syntaxes</li><li>Libraries for regular expressions, string handling</li><li>UNIX system calls and extended data structures</li><li>Create interpreted or compiled shell scripts written in Scheme for UNIX or Windows</li><li>Compiled C files can be easily distributed</li><li>Allows the creation of fully self-contained statically linked executables</li><li>On systems that support it, compiled code can be loaded dynamically</li></ul><p>This manual is merely a reference for the CHICKEN system and assumes a working knowledge of Scheme.</p><p>The manual is split in the following sections:</p><dl><dt><a href='basic-mode-of-operation.html' class='internal'>Basic mode of operation</a></dt><dd>Compiling Scheme files.</dd><dt><a href='using-the-compiler.html' class='internal'>Using the compiler</a></dt><dd>Explains how to use CHICKEN to compile programs and execute them.</dd><dt><a href='using-the-interpreter.html' class='internal'>Using the interpreter</a></dt><dd>Invocation and usage of <tt>csi</tt>, the CHICKEN interpreter</dd><dt><a href='supported-language.html' class='internal'>Supported language</a></dt><dd>The language implemented by CHICKEN (deviations from the standard and extensions).</dd><dt><a href='interface-to-external-functions-and-variables.html' class='internal'>Interface to external functions and variables</a></dt><dd>Accessing C and C++ code and data.</dd><dt><a href='chicken-setup.html' class='internal'>chicken-setup</a></dt><dd>Packaging and installing extension libraries.</dd><dt><a href='data-representation.html' class='internal'>Data representation</a></dt><dd>How Scheme data is internally represented.</dd><dt><a href='bugs-and-limitations.html' class='internal'>Bugs and limitations</a></dt><dd>Yes, there are some.</dd><dt><a href='faq.html' class='internal'>FAQ</a></dt><dd>A list of Frequently Asked Questions about CHICKEN (and their answers!).</dd><dt><a href='acknowledgements.html' class='internal'>Acknowledgements</a></dt><dd>A list of some of the people that have contributed to make CHICKEN what it is.</dd><dt><a href='bibliography.html' class='internal'>Bibliography</a></dt><dd>Links to documents that may be of interest.</dd></dl>
