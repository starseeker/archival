[para] This document is a guide for developers working on Critcl,
i.e. maintainers fixing bugs, extending the package's functionality,
etc.

[para]

Please read

[list_begin enum]
[enum] [term {Critcl - License}],
[enum] [term {Critcl - How To Get The Sources}], and
[enum] [term {Critcl - The Installer's Guide}]
[list_end]

first, if that was not done already.

[para] Here we assume that the sources are already available in a directory
of your choice, and that you not only know how to build and install
them, but also have all the necessary requisites to actually do
so. The guide to the sources in particular also explains which source
code management system is used, where to find it, how to set it up,
etc.

[subsection Requirements]

To develop for critcl the following packages and applications must be
available in the environment. These are all used by the [cmd build.tcl]
helper application.

[list_begin definitions]
[def [syscmd dtplite]]

A Tcl application provided by Tcllib, for the validation and
conversion of [term doctools]-formatted text.

[def [syscmd dia]]

A Tcl application provided by Tklib, for the validation and conversion
of [package diagram]-formatted figures into raster images.

[para] Do not confuse this with the Gnome [syscmd dia] application,
which is a graphical editor for figures and diagrams, and completely
unrelated.

[def [package fileutil]]
A Tcl package provided by Tcllib, providing file system utilities.

[def "[package vfs::mk4], [package vfs]"]
Tcl packages written in C providing access to Tcl's VFS facilities,
required for the generation of critcl starkits and starpacks.

[comment =====================================================================]
[def Helpers]
[list_begin definitions]
[def [file build.tcl]]

This helper application provides various operations needed by a
developer for critcl, like regenerating the documentation, the
figures, building and installing critcl, etc.

[para] Running the command like

[example {
	./build.tcl help
}]

will provide more details about the available operations and their
arguments.
[list_end]

[comment =====================================================================]
[def Documentation]
[list_begin definitions]
[def [file doc/]]

This directory contains the documentation sources, for both the text, and the figures.
The texts are written in [term doctools] format, whereas the figures are written for
tklib's [package dia](gram) package and application.

[def [file embedded/]]

This directory contains the documentation converted to regular manpages
(nroff) and HTML.

It is called embedded because these files, while derived, are part of the
git repository, i.e. embedded into it. This enables us to place these files
where they are visible when serving the prject's web interface.

[list_end]

[comment =====================================================================]
[def Testsuite]
[list_begin definitions]
[def [file test/all.tcl]]
[def [file test/testutilities.tcl]]
[def [file test/*.test]]

These files are a standard testsuite based on Tcl's [package tcltest] package,
with some utility code snarfed from [package Tcllib].

[para] This currently tests only some of the [package stubs::*] packages.

[def [file test/*.tcl]]

These files (but not [file all.tcl], and [file testutilities.tcl]) are
example files (Tcl with embedded C) which can be run through critcl for testing.

[para] [emph TODO:] These should be converted into a proper test suite.

[def {Package Code, Per Package}]
[list_begin definitions][comment ----------------------PCPP]

[def [package critcl]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critcl]
[def [file lib/critcl/critcl.tcl]]
The Tcl code implementing the package.

[def [file lib/critcl/Config]]
The configuration file for the standard targets and their settings.

[def [file lib/critcl/critcl_c/]]
Various C code snippets used by the package.

This directory also contains the copies of the Tcl header files used
to compile the assembled C code, for the major brnaches of Tcl,
i.e. 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.

[list_end][comment -----------------------------critcl]

[def [package critcl::util]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critcl::util]
[def [file lib/critcl-util/util.tcl]]
The Tcl code implementing the package.
[list_end][comment -----------------------------critcl::util]

[def [package critcl::app]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critcl::app]
[def [file lib/app-critcl/critcl.tcl]]
The Tcl code implementing the package.
[list_end][comment -----------------------------critcl::app]

[def [package critcl::iassoc]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critcl::iassoc]
[def [file lib/critcl-iassoc/iassoc.tcl]]
The Tcl code implementing the package.
[def [file lib/critcl-iassoc/iassoc.h]]
C code template used by the package.
[list_end][comment -----------------------------critcl::iassoc]

[def [package critcl::class]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critcl::class]
[def [file lib/critcl-class/class.tcl]]
The Tcl code implementing the package.
[def [file lib/critcl-class/class.h]]
C code template used by the package.
[list_end][comment -----------------------------critcl::class]

[def [package dict84]]
[def [package lassign84]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------util84]
[def [file lib/util84/dict.tcl]]
[def [file lib/util84/lassign.tcl]]

These are two packages implementing forward compatibility emulations
of the [cmd dict] and [cmd lassign] commands introduced with Tcl 8.5.
These are used automatically when critcl is run by Tcl 8.4.

[list_end][comment -----------------------------util84]

[def [package stubs::*]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------stubs]
[def [file lib/stubs/*]]

A set of non-public (still) packages which provide read and write
access to and represent Tcl stubs tables. These were created by taking
the [file genStubs.tcl] helper application coming with the Tcl core
sources apart along its internal logical lines.

[list_end][comment -----------------------------stubs]

[def [package critclf]]
[list_begin definitions][comment ---------------critclf]
[def [file lib/critclf/]]

Arjen Markus' work on a critcl/Fortran. The code is outdated and has
not been adapted to the changes in critcl version 3 yet.

[list_end][comment -----------------------------critclf]

[def [package autoscroll]]
[def [package cmdline]]
[def [package md5]]
[def [package md5c]]
[def [package platform]]
[def [package snit]]
[def [package snitbutton]]
[def [package wikit]]

These are all external packages whose code has been inlined in the
repository for easier development (less dependencies to pull), and
quicker deployment from the repository (generation of starkit and
-pack).

[para] The packages
[package autoscroll],
[package snit],
[package snitbutton], and
[package wikit]
are for the support of the Wikit GUI accessible from starkit and -pack
when the application functionality ([package critcl::app]) is run with
an empty command line.

[para] [emph TODO:] These should all be checked against their origin
for updates and changes since they were inlined.
