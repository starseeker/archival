[list_begin enumerated]

[enum]  Fixed the code generated by [cmd critcl::c++command].
        The emitted code handed a non-static string table to
	[fun Tcl_GetIndexFromObj], in violation of the contract, which
	requires the table to have a fixed address. This was a memory
	smash waiting to happen. Thanks to Brian Griffin for alrerting
	us to the general problem.
