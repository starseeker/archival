'\"	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
'\"	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
'\"	needed;  use .AS below instead)
'\"
'\" .AS ?type? ?name?
'\"	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Welcome to the \fIC Runtime In Tcl\fR, \fICriTcl\fR for short, a
system to build C extension packages for Tcl on the fly, from C code
embedded within Tcl scripts, for all who wish to make their code go
faster.
.PP
This document is the reference manpage for the \fBcritcl::class\fR
package. This package provides convenience commands for advanced
functionality built on top of the core.
.PP
With it a user wishing to create a C level object with class
and instance commands can concentrate on specifying the class- and
instance-variables and -methods in a manner similar to a TclOO class,
while all the necessary boilerplate around it is managed by this
package.
.PP
Its intended audience are mainly developers wishing to write
Tcl packages with embedded C code.
.PP
This package resides in the Core Package Layer of CriTcl.

.SH API
.TP
\fB::critcl::class::def\fR \fIname\fR \fIscript\fR
This is the main command to define a new class \fIname\fR, where
\fIname\fR is the name of the Tcl command representing the class,
i.e. the \fIclass command\fR. The \fIscript\fR provides the
specification of the class, i.e. information about included headers,
class- and instance variables, class- and instance-methods, etc.
See the section \fBClass Specification API\fR below for the
detailed list of the available commands and their semantics.
.PP
.SH "CLASS SPECIFICATION API"
Here we documents all class specification commands available inside of
the class definition script argument of \fB::critcl::class::define\fR.
.SS "GENERAL CONFIGURATION"
.TP
\fBinclude\fR \fIpath\fR
This command specifies the path of a header file to include within the
code generated for the class. This is separate from the \fBsupport\fR
because the generated include directives will be put at the very
beginning of the generated code. This is done to allow the use of the
imported declarations within the instance type, and elsewhere.
.sp
The command can be used multiple times, each adding a header to
include. It is of course possible to not use this command at all, for
classing not making use of external definitions.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.TP
\fBsupport\fR \fIcode\fR
This command specifies supporting C code, i.e. any definitions (types,
functions, etc.) needed by the \fIwhole\fR class and not fitting into
class- and instance-methods. The code is embedded at global level,
outside of any function or other definition.
.sp
The command can be used multiple times, each adding another
segment of C code to insert. It is of course possible to not use this
command at all, for classes not requiring swupporting code.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.TP
\fBtype\fR \fIname\fR
This command specifies the name of an external C type to be used as
the type of the instance structure.
.sp
Initialization and release of the structure with the given type
are the responsibility of the user, through \fBconstructor\fR and
\fBdestructor\fR code fragments.
.sp
\fIAttention:\fR Using this command precludes the use of
regular class- and instance variables. It further precludes the use of
\fBmethod-introspection\fR as well, as this make use of generated
instance-variables.
.sp
If class- and/or instance-variable have to be used in
conjunction with an external C type, simply create and use a class- or
instance-variable with that type.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.PP
.SS "CLASS LIFETIME MANAGEMENT"
.TP
\fBclassconstructor\fR \fIbody\fR
This command specifies a C code block surrounding the initialization
of the class variables, i.e. the fields of the class structure.
\fINote\fR that allocation and release of the class structure itself
is done by the system andf not the responsibility of the user.
.sp
For the initialization (and release) of a class variable it is
recommended to use the \fIconstructor\fR and \fIdestructor\fR
arguments of the variable's definition (See command
\fBclassvariable\fR) for this instead of using a separate
\fBclassconstructor\fR.
.sp
This is an optional command. Using it more than once is allowed
too and each use will add another C code fragment to use during
construction. I.e. multiple calls aggregate.
.sp
The C code blocks of multiple calls (including the constructors
of classvariable definitions) are executed in order of specification.
.sp
The result of the command is the empty string.
.sp
The C code in \fIbody\fR has access to the following
environment:
.RS
.TP
\fBinterp\fR
Pointer to the Tcl interpreter (Tcl_Interp*) the
class structure will be associated with. It enables the generation
of a Tcl error message should construction fail.
.TP
\fBclass\fR
Pointer to the class structure to initialize.
.TP
error
A C code label the constructor can jump to should it have
to signal a construction failure. It is the responsibility of the
constructor to release any variables already initialized before
jumping to this label. This also why the 'execution in order of
specification' is documented and can be relied on. It gives us the
knowledge which other constructors have already been run and
initialized what other fields.
.RE
.TP
\fBclassdestructor\fR \fIbody\fR
This command specifies a C code block surrounding the release of the
class variables, i.e. the fields of the class structure.

These are effectively local forms of the commands
\fBclassconstructor\fR and \fBclassdestructor\fR. Please read their

.TP
\fBclassmethod\fR \fIname\fR \fBcommand\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIbody\fR
This command specifies a class method and the C code block
implementing its functionality. This is the first of three forms. The
method is specified like a \fBcritcl::ccommand\fR, with a fixed set of
C-level arguments. The \fIbody\fR has to perform everything
(i.e. argument extraction, checking, result return, and of course the
actual functionality) by itself.
.sp
For this the \fIbody\fR has access to

.RE
.IP
The \fIarguments\fR of the definition are only a human readable form
of the method arguments and syntax and are not used in the C code,
except as comments put into the generated code. Again, it is the
responsibility of the \fIbody\fR to check the number of arguments,
extract them, check their types, etc.
.TP
\fBclassmethod\fR \fIname\fR \fBproc\fR \fIarguments\fR \fIresulttype\fR \fIbody\fR
This command specifies a class method and the C code block
implementing its functionality.  This is the second of three forms. The
method is specified like a \fBcritcl::cproc\fR.
Contrary to the first variant here the \fIarguments\fR are computer
readable, expected to be in the same format as the \fIarguments\fR of
\fBcritcl::cproc\fR. The same is true for the \fIresulttype\fR.
The system automatically generates a wrapper doing argument checking
and conversion, and result conversion, like for \fBcritcl::cproc\fR.

This command specifies a class method and the C code block
implementing its functionality. This is the third and last of three
forms.
.sp
The class method is implemented by the external function
\fIfunname\fR, i.e. a function which is declared outside of the class
code itself, or in a \fBsupport\fR block.

and conversion, and result conversion, like for \fBcritcl::cproc\fR.
.sp
The \fIbody\fR has access to
.RS
.TP
\fBinstance\fR
Pointer to the instance structure.
.TP
\fBinterp\fR
Pointer to the Tcl interpreter (Tcl_Interp*) the
instance structure is associated with
.TP
...
All \fIarguments\fR under their specified names and C types
as per their definition.
.RE
.TP
\fBmethod\fR \fIname\fR \fBas\fR \fIfunname\fR ?\fIarg\fR...?
This command specifies an instance method and the C code block
implementing its functionality. This is the third and last of three
forms.
.sp
The instance method is implemented by the external function
\fIfunname\fR, i.e. a function which is declared outside of the instance
code itself, or in a \fBsupport\fR block.
.sp
It is assumed that the first four arguments of that function
represent the parameters
.RS
.TP
\fBinstance\fR
Pointer to the instance structure.
.TP
\fBinterp\fR
Pointer to the Tcl interpreter (Tcl_Interp*) the
instance structure is associated with
.TP
\fBobjc\fR
The number of method arguments.
.TP
\fBobjv\fR
The method arguments, as C array of Tcl_Obj pointers.
.RE
.IP
Any additional arguments specified will be added after these and are
passed into the C code as is, i.e. are considered to be C expressions.
.TP
\fBmethod_introspection\fR
This command generates one class- and one instance-method both of
which will return a list of the instance methods of the class, and
supporting structures, like the function to compute the information,
and a class variable caching it.
.sp
The two methods and the class variable are all named
\fBmethods\fR.
.PP
.SS "CONTEXT DEPENDENT INTERACTIONS"
This section documents the various interactions between the
specification commands. While these are are all documented with the
individual commands here they are pulled together to see at a glance.
.IP [1]
If you are using the command \fBtype\fR to specify an external
C type to use for the instance structure you are subject to
the following constraints and rules:
.RS
.IP [1]
You cannot define your own instance variables.
.IP [2]
You cannot define your own class variables.
.IP [3]
You cannot use \fBmethod_introspection\fR.
.IP [4]
You have to allocate and release the instance structure on your
own, through \fBconstructor\fR and \fBdestructor\fR code blocks.
.RE
.IP [2]
If you declare class variables you are subject to the
following constraints and rules:
.RS
.IP [1]
You cannot use \fBtype\fR.
.IP [2]
The system generates an instance variable \fBclass\fR for
you, which points from instance to class structure. This makes
you also subject to the rules below, for instance variables.
.RE
.IP [3]
If you declare instance variables (possibly automatic, see
above) you are subject to following constraints and rules:
.RS
.IP [1]
You cannot use \fBtype\fR.
.IP [2]
The system generates and manages an instance variable
\fBcmd\fR for you, which holds the Tcl_Command token
of the instance command.
.IP [3]
The system generates an instance method \fBdestroy\fR for
you.
.IP [4]
The system manages allocation and release of the instance
structure for you. You have to care only about the instance
variables themselves.
.RE
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
The example shown below is the specification of queue data structure,
with most of the method implementations and support code omitted to
keep the size down.
.PP
The full implementation can be found in the directory
"\fIexamples/queue\fR" of the critcl source distribution/repository.
