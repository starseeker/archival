# stackc.tcl --
#
#       Implementation of a stack data structure for Tcl.
#       This code based on critcl v3.1, API compatible to the PTI [x].
#       [x] Pure Tcl Implementation.
#
# Demonstrates not just the stubs import and meta data declaration,
# but also the utility package for the creation of classes and objects
# in C, with both claaes and their instances represented as Tcl
# commands.
