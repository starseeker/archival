1. General Installation Instructions
------------------------------------

To install Ayam into your system switch to root, cd to ayam/bin and enter:
> make install

By default, Ayam will install to "/usr/local/ayam".
It will create some sub-directories there, namely:
/usr/local/ayam/bin for the executable, plugins, and scripts,
/usr/local/ayam/doc for the documentation, and
/usr/local/ayam/scn for the example scenes.

You may want to add "/usr/local/ayam/bin" to your PATH environment variable.
Use ayam.sh to start the application or be sure to add "." or
"/usr/local/ayam/bin/plugins" to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable. Otherwise Ayam might not be able to load the plugins.

The installation procedure will also install the current Makefile,
that may be used to uninstall Ayam again, e.g. using:
> make -f /usr/local/ayam/bin/Makefile uninstall

The Makefile may be adapted on systems where "/usr/local/ayam" is not
a feasible prefix directory, just change the PREFIX variable.
Note that PREFIX must end in an Ayam specific directory; spreading the
executables, plugins, Tcl scripts, documentation, and example scenes across
the file system is not supported.

To check what installing/uninstalling will do to your system use
> make -n install
or
> make -n uninstall
first.

Ayam also integrates with Unix desktop environments.
The next steps need the xdg-utils from the Portland project to be installed.

To install a system wide applications menu entry, enter:
root> make sysmenu

The next commands should not be run as root!

If Ayam was installed to a user specific directory (e.g. on systems
without root access) use the menu target instead of sysmenu:
user> make menu

To add a desktop launcher to the current users desktop, enter:
user> make desktop

To create a file type on the current users desktop:
user> make filetype

Some desktop environments require a restart to let these changes take effect!
